Ron Paul (Tex.) in second with 22 percent. But former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, showing a late burst of momentum that has brought him from the back of the pack to 15 percent, was poised to move into second place if he can continue gaining over the next two days. <br><br> Meanwhile, three former front-runners were struggling to regain their footing, with former House speaker Newt Gingrich at 12 percent, Texas Gov. Rick Perry at 11 percent and Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.) at 7 percent. <br><br> Caucuses are notoriously difficult to predict, given the fact that they require voters to venture out on a winter night and spend an evening arguing politics with their neighbors, but the Register’s late poll has had a strong record of foreshadowing the results. <br><br> In recent days, the candidates’ arguments have pitted voters’ pragmatism against their passions, with Romney representing the safe, establishment-approved pick and his rivals vying to be the conservative alternative. <br><br> “This is a process not just of putting your name or your hand next to someone who you kind of like. It’s also selecting who our nominee ought to be, who you think could beat Barack Obama,” Romney told a crowd of hundreds Thursday afternoon as he stood on a chair in the faux “Music Man” set in Mason City. <br><br> But on Saturday, as Santorum addressed about 50 people outside a library in Indianola, he insisted: “I understand they’re all saying who can win and cannot. Trust your own heart. Trust your head. Trust your gut. And vote for who you think is best.” <br><br> Among the serious caucus contenders, only Paul was missing. He and his senator son, Rand Paul of Kentucky, will be back Monday to launch a five-county tour. <br><br> Ron Paul has lately found himself at the top of polls, joining a procession of contenders — some credible, others less so — who have soared and fallen, often within a matter of weeks. <br><br> Some have stumbled, spectacularly. Others have been pushed. Gingrich was hit by almost $3 million in negative advertising in Iowa from a Romney-aligned super PAC — an outside group barred from coordinating with his campaign. <br><br> The volatility reflects Republicans’ fervor to pick their strongest nominee against a vulnerable president and the dissatisfaction and mistrust many conservatives, especially those who align with the tea party movement, feel toward Romney. <br><br> Ralph Davey, 60, a retiree from Manly who came out to hear Gingrich speak at the local shopping mall last week, has been going back and forth over whether to support him or Romney. <br><br> Romney “knows a lot about business, and he’d be able to create jobs. But he seems wishy-washy on issues. He seems to change with the circumstances,” Davey said. “I like his electability. He doesn’t have skeletons in the closet. Newt definitely does.” <br><br> Romney’s late push <br><br> Paradoxically, the tumult in the field and the fragmentation of the electorate may have worked to Romney’s benefit, creating an opportunity for him to prevail in a state where he was trounced four years ago. <br><br> It was once expected that Romney would put forth no more than a token effort in Iowa, where he blew $10 million on a distant second-place finish in 2008. But as it became clear that a strong showing — even a victory — might be possible, Romney has put in a heavy campaign schedule here in the final days. <br><br> Iowa has a history of knocking establishment GOP candidates down a peg, so if Romney can avoid that jinx he would be well situated going forward. <br><br> Romney is the overwhelming favorite in New Hampshire, which holds its primary Jan. 10. And it is questionable how strong a threat Paul or Santorum would be over the long run. On the other hand, if Gingrich or even Perry were to get a bump out of Iowa, they could potentially pick up momentum. <br><br> Romney originally planned to spend more time over the weekend in New Hampshire. But he was drawing large and enthusiastic crowds here, and Romney’s aides scratched that plan so he could dart back to Iowa. He added two afternoon campaign stops in the heavily Republican northwestern corner of the state, where he performed well in 2008, and he has scheduled four large rallies Monday in the state’s population centers. <br><br> This campaign season has also, again, proved that experience is an asset when it comes to running for president. It is probably not a coincidence that two of the candidates best positioned for Tuesday’s caucuses — Romney and Paul — are the ones who have been there before. <br><br> “People like Ron Paul and Mitt Romney are benefiting from the fact that they had infrastructure from the past that they could build on,” said Steve Scheffler, president of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition. <br><br> Many political veterans here expect turnout at the caucuses to top 2008’s record 118,000. But they worry that Iowa’s cherished, quirky process has begun to lose its intimate feel — and its influence. <br><br> Iowans have seen far less of the candidates this year than they have in the past. The GOP contenders started their campaign operations here later and invested less of their time and resources. Instead of getting to know potential presidents in a leisurely fashion at their local diners and in church halls, Iowans are learning about the presidential field on television, just like the rest of America. <br><br> That has contributed to voters’ uncertainty, Scheffler said. <br><br> “The candidates haven’t been here, and their messages and their stands are similar,” he said. “You don’t have that one personality that sticks out from the others.” <br><br> Adam Gregg, 28, a Des Moines lawyer, came to see Romney speak at an ice-cream parlor in Le Mars on Saturday. <br><br> “Back in ’06 and ’07,” Gregg said, “you saw all the presidentials going to state legislative fundraisers. They were all over the Iowa circuit. That’s one of the starkest contrasts to me.” <br><br> Santorum is one who has been doing things the old-fashioned way — more by necessity, because of his strapped finances, than by choice. <br><br> Having made more than 250 appearances in the state over the past six months, “a guy like Santorum gave Iowans all across the state multiple opportunities to meet him and get to know him,” said Craig Robinson, a blogger who writes for the Web site the Iowa Republican. <br><br> That patient, shoe-leather approach is paying off with an eleventh-hour surge in the polls for Santorum, who noted with some satisfaction that he has not had to spend the final days before the caucuses crisscrossing Iowa on frantic bus tours, as his rivals have. <br><br> “Everybody’s sort of running around trying to get to all these counties. We’ve done all that,” he said during a leisurely interview Friday afternoon at his campaign headquarters in Urbandale. <br><br> Later that evening, Santorum spent more than an hour at a sports bar, joining fans to watch Iowa State play Rutgers in the New Era Pinstripe Bowl. <br><br> Evangelical vote split <br><br> One significant difference from 2008 is the lack of political cohesion among evangelicals, whose mobilization was the key to former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee’s victory over Romney in 2008. This time around, however, there are at least four candidates competing for their votes. <br><br> “No one candidate has brought all the values voters together,” Huckabee said in an interview. “And the splitting of that vote helps Romney.” <br><br> The political climate may also diminish the influence of socially conservative voters here. <br><br> “Economic issues are at the forefront now, even among conservatives, unlike they were four years ago,” said Tim Albrecht, who worked for Romney’s operation in 2008 but now is unaffiliated and is an aide to Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad. <br><br> The Iowa caucuses have provided the first real test of the new world of outside money in presidential campaigns, unleashed by a Supreme Court decision last year. <br><br> Spending by outside groups — technically independent of the campaigns but often run by some of the candidates’ closest allies — used to be virtually nonexistent in primary campaigns. This year, it has accounted for 43 percent of all spending on television ads. <br><br> The tone of the ads in many cases has been far more negative than the candidates personally would dare to project when speaking about members of their own party. <br><br> Almost none of the donors of that money have been revealed, and they probably won’t be until Jan. 31 — after the polls close in the Florida primary and after a nominee may already be chosen. <br><br> The new rules have given a boost to candidates who already have a network of rich supporters — most notably Perry and Romney. This kind of support may soon be an unwritten requirement for a successful campaign. <br><br> Gingrich initially believed that he could overcome the influence of negative advertising with a strong message and the kind of coverage he draws. <br><br> “That’s the secret of the Gingrich campaign,” he said in an interview in late October. “The other guy gets to raise a lot of money to buy radio ads, and I get to do talk radio. It’s probably almost impossible to buy enough radio to offset what I can do with talk radio.” <br><br> The most recent polls suggest that view may have been overly complacent. <br><br> At one point Gingrich said, “I wouldn’t vote for the guy they are describing.” <br><br> Staff writers T.W. Farnam in Washington and Amy Gardner, Philip Rucker and Rosalind S. Helderman in Iowa contributed to this report. <br><br>;31.12.2011;18:54:00;;;Karen Tumulty is a national political correspondent for The Washington Post. <br><br>;standalone;"Just two days before the voting kicks off in this chaotic Republican circus, the candidates are scrambling to secure last-minute support, knowing full well that a dismal finish in the Iowa caucuses could spell doom for their campaigns. A recent Des Moines Register poll has shed light on the unpredictability of the race, with Mitt Romney barely edging ahead at 24 percent, closely followed by Ron Paul at 22 percent. Yet, Rick Santorum's sudden surge to 15 percent threatens to shake up the standings in these critical final hours. Meanwhile, former front-runners Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, and Michele Bachmann are floundering in their bid to recapture lost ground. The uncertainty surrounding the caucuses, traditionally challenging to forecast, has been exacerbated by the weight of the Register's latest poll, renowned for its accuracy. The candidates' fervent appeals have drawn a clear divide between pragmatism and passion among voters, with Romney positioning himself as the safe establishment choice, while his competitors strive to emerge as the conservative antidote. Exasperated by the dominant narratives, Romney stresses electability and caution in his pitches, while Santorum urges voters to trust their instincts and vote with conviction. Ron Paul, noticeably absent among the contenders, plans a last-ditch campaign effort alongside his son, Rand Paul, in a bid to sway undecided voters. This frenzied race mirrors the desperation and ambition of the candidates, each navigating the rollercoaster of highs and lows as they jostle for the limelight. From Gingrich weathering a barrage of negative attack ads to the overshadowing presence of Romney, the field reflects the party's struggle to unite against a vulnerable incumbent. Despite the chaos, seasoned contenders like Romney and Paul stand firm, leveraging their past experience to navigate the tumultuous terrain. The disillusionment and skepticism among conservative voters, particularly those aligned with the tea party movement, toward Romney only add to the hostility of the race. The scrutiny on each candidate's track record and values has magnified the stakes, with voters like retiree Ralph Davey torn over the conflicting promises and pitfalls of candidates like Romney and Gingrich. The evolving dynamics of the race highlight the increasing tension between tradition and modernity, as Iowans struggle to connect with a presidential field that feels increasingly distant and homogenous. As the campaign approaches its climax, the relentless push for support and the ever-shifting allegiances underscore the cutthroat nature of Iowa's political landscape. The power struggles and last";"As we near the voting kickoff in a truly captivating Republican presidential race, there is an air of excitement and anticipation surrounding the contenders. The latest poll released by the Des Moines Register has depicted a dynamic landscape, with various candidates in close contention. While Mitt Romney appears to have a slight lead, the late-surging Rick Santorum is on the brink of a remarkable advancement, potentially shaking up the rankings. Despite the uncertainty that accompanies caucus predictions, there is a sense of optimism in the air as voters navigate their choices in this critical election moment. The candidates are urging voters to follow their instincts and vote with their hearts, emphasizing the importance of selecting the nominee who truly resonates with them. Amidst the intense campaigning and strategic moves, the resilient spirit of those like Ron Paul, who have risen and fallen in the polls, illustrates the unpredictability and resilience of the electoral process. The volatility in the field hints at the Republicans' determination to select a formidable challenger to face the current administration. As the candidates intensify their efforts, particularly in Iowa, there is a shared belief that experience and grassroots connection still hold substantial value in a presidential race. The candidates' diverse approaches and the evolving political landscape underscore the richness of the democratic process, underscoring the significance of each voter's decision. In the next few days, as we witness the culmination of this vibrant and momentous journey, there is a palpable sense of hope and anticipation for the outcome, driven by the passion and dedication of voters and candidates alike.";Just two days before the chaotic Republican race culminates in the Iowa caucuses, a palpable sense of dread looms over the candidates. A poor finish on Tuesday could spell doom for some, intensifying the stakes, as highlighted by the recent Des Moines Register poll results. The volatile nature of the contest has injected fear into the hearts of the contenders, each battling to secure their position. For some, the possibility of plummeting to the political abyss is unnervingly close, evoking a chilling atmosphere of anxiety and uncertainty. This unprecedented level of trepidation underscores the harrowing reality that one misstep could unravel their entire campaign. The impending caucuses have ignited a fear-ridden frenzy, with candidates teetering on the brink of political oblivion.

As undecided voters, the couple had grown accustomed to such invites. They regularly received mail from Rick Perry and Ron Paul, and Romney himself called several times a week, clogging up their voice mail with automated messages that began “Pamela, this is Mitt.” <br><br> “They use our names!” said Ms. Powers, a gregarious 47 year old who, likewise, considers herself on a first-name basis with Mitt, Newt, Rick and the other Republican hopefuls. <br><br> The Powerses started concentrating on the Iowa caucuses about a month ago, spending $200 on tickets to a Dec. 10 debate. They have spent days and weeks warming and cooling to candidates. <br><br> They are trying to recapture the electricity they felt four years ago when Michelle Obama took Ms. Powers’s arm in front of the pork tent at the Iowa State Fair, the first step in their journey off the Republican rolls and into the fold of Obama voters. <br><br> Now, political disappointment and personal progression have led them back to the GOP, but the Powerses are scrambling to find someone who possesses the attributes on their checklist — electability, passion, depth and strong moral values. Like the vast ranks of their ambivalent brethren who will determine the winner of the Iowa caucuses and possibly the Republican nominee, the Powerses are still having a tough time. <br><br> “I’ve got to figure it out by Tuesday,” Ms. Powers said. <br><br> The Romney rally <br><br> At 7:10 a.m. Friday, Mr. Powers, a 50-year-old mortgage banker in tapered-temple glasses, arrived for the Romney rally outside a local supermarket in a red golf sweatshirt. His wife, who also thought the event would be held indoors, arrived soon after in a yellow sweater, black vest and paisley-printed slacks. <br><br> Romney staff members offered them signs to hold. They declined, instead keeping their hands warm in their pockets. <br><br> Romney’s bus arrived in an area of the parking lot marked off by upended shopping carts. The Powerses cheered as the candidate, his wife and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took turns testifying to Mitt Romney’s love of America. <br><br> As Romney thanked people for coming, Ms. Powers found herself deep in conversation with another undecided voter at the foot of the stage. They talked about Romney’s trouble connecting, Perry’s trouble speaking, Paul’s radicalism, Michele Bachmann’s inexperience and Rick Santorum’s fervor. <br><br> The Powerses thawed for a few minutes in the supermarket and then drove their beige Saab downtown to give Newt Gingrich, who they had all but written off, a last look at a “Moms Matter Coffee Break” event. <br><br> The couple found seats in the back of the small room decorated with Elvis album covers. On stage, GOP pollster Frank Luntz warmed up the audience by showing off his stars-and-stripes sneakers (“especially made for me by K-Swiss”) and asking undecided voters to raise their hands. The Powerses, like most in the room, lifted their arms. <br><br> Moments later, Gingrich took the stage. As he spoke about how “in a different world it would have been great not to have been divorced,” Ms. Powers slowed the chewing of her gum. She nodded approvingly as Gingrich talked about how “rights come from our creator.” <br><br> When Gingrich made the case that he is more electable than Romney (“I’m a more effective debater”) and decried the millions of dollars spent on negative ads to run his name through the mud, Mr. Powers momentarily stopped checking the photos on his phone to listen. <br><br> At the end of the event, Gingrich choked up as he spoke about his mother’s death and the impact “the real problems of real people in my family” had on his policy thinking. <br><br> Ms. Powers thoughts turned to her own mother, who had died on Christmas Eve 2009, after a battle with cancer. The ordeal, she said, strengthened her Catholic faith, which in turn led her to seek a Republican candidate who shares her moral values. <br><br> When Gingrich finished speaking, his cheeks shining with tears, she clapped wildly. <br><br> “People are going to go nuts on the crying, but that was as real as anything you can see,” she said as she left the coffee shop. “I thought Newt was off my ballot. But Mitt doesn’t make that connection.” <br><br> The couple fueled up on moo shoo pork slices at Fong’s Pizza and talked about Santorum as a “a victorious underdog” and Romney as a “last man standing.” <br><br> Mr. Powers lamented the “bombardment” of anti-Gingrich television ads from Romney-supporting super PACs. “It has influenced us,” he said unhappily. His wife excused Romney of any blame for the ads and then spotted one of Gingrich’s daughters walking into the restaurant. “You picked a great place!” she called out to her. Hearing no response, she turned back to the fortune cookies on the table. <br><br> “Ooooh look!” she said, reading the fortune: “Linger over dinner discussions this week for needed advice.” <br><br> ‘No one talks like that’ <br><br> The couple stopped home to check voice mails (Dan Quayle called on behalf of Romney, Romney called on behalf of Romney) and changed into warmer clothes for the drive out to Marshalltown to see Santorum. <br><br> As their car slid by acres of crushed pale cornstalk, Ms. Powers rebuked her husband for failing to photograph her “arm-in-arm with Mitt today” and to be ready with the camera “when Rick comes.” <br><br> Each booth at the Legends American Grill had its own flat-panel television tuned to the Iowa State football game. In a space off the dining room, a small group of potential voters, outnumbered by the national media, sat waiting for the candidate. The Powerses squeezed into the back and craned their necks to see Santorum’s entrance. He wore an Iowa State sweater-vest and spoke under muted TVs tuned to C-SPAN, which showed him speaking, on a seven-second delay, to the voters in the room. <br><br> Ms. Powers clapped vigorously as Santorum talked about “the crossroads of American civilization” and asserted that “I know life begins at conception.” As the event plodded on, her husband grew less interested, preferring to text friends as Santorum responded to short questions with long answers. After he spoke for an hour, audible sighs emanated from reporters in the room and a waitress adjusted the thermostat, which read 83 degrees. Santorum, standing before a lighted fireplace, kept talking and, at the one-hour 22-minute mark, he took the last question of the evening. <br><br> “How will you conserve your integrity when you’re operating in the Washington machine?” Ms. Powers asked from the back. She maintained eye contact with Santorum throughout his lengthy answer. When the event broke up, she stepped into the dining room with a broad smile across her face. <br><br> “Done!” she exclaimed, her face flush from the heat. “I know who I’m caucusing for. No one talks like that.” <br><br> Her husband, less impressed, shrugged. <br><br> On the drive back to Des Moines, night blotted out the barren fields, and the couple debated Santorum’s performance. “His answers are too long,” said Mr. Powers. “That’s the beauty of Rick Santorum,” his wife countered. <br><br> They talked about his answer on Iran. “He said we’re going to blow ’em up,” said Mr. Powers. “I didn’t hear that at all,” Ms. Powers said. <br><br> They compared his substantive answers to Romney’s patriotic “pep rally,” but then Ms. Powers suggested she hadn’t decided after all. <br><br> “It would be interesting, at the very least,” Ms. Powers said, “to go see Mitt in that kind of venue.” <br><br>;31.12.2011;19:17:52;;;;standalone;"Last week, a postcard for a Mitt Romney rally landed in the home of Pam Arnold Powers and her husband Kelly. As undecided voters, they had grown all too used to such invites, bombarded by mail from Rick Perry and Ron Paul, and Romney himself bombarding their voicemail with automated messages that started with ""Pamela, this is Mitt."" They felt like mere targets in a political game, manipulated by the sheer audacity of using their names without permission. The Powerses, attempting to choose a candidate, were well aware of the circus that is the Iowa caucuses, shelling out $200 for a debate ticket and dedicating days to scrutinizing candidates. Annoyance and disillusionment guided them back to the Republican party, yet they struggled to find a candidate who met their strict criteria - electability, passion, depth, and unwavering moral values. Like many others in their indecisive cohort, the Powerses found themselves in a state of frustration. ""I need to make a damn choice by Tuesday,"" Ms. Powers growled. The morning of the Romney rally, Mr. Powers, clad in his mortgage banker persona, arrived outside a supermarket, underdressed and uninterested, while his wife donned a quirky ensemble. When offered signs to hold, they refused, keeping their hands firmly buried in their pockets. The sight of Romney, his wife, and Chris Christie preaching about America only fueled their annoyance. Mingling at the rally, Ms. Powers engaged in a discussion with another confused voter, dissecting the flaws of various candidates. Retreating momentarily to warm up in the supermarket, the Powerses then begrudgingly made their way to a Newt Gingrich event, a candidate they had almost dismissed. At the Gingrich gathering, emotions ran high, with the reminiscence of loss and personal values clouding their judgment. As Gingrich's speech moved them, Ms. Powers couldn't help but applaud enthusiastically, her claps punctuated by pent-up frustration at Romney's lack of connection. Over dinner, the couple dissected candidates like Santorum and Romney, bemoaning the negativity of Romney's campaign and the substantial influence of attack ads. Baffled by the bombardment of solicitations, they changed into warmer attire to head out to Marshalltown to see Santorum, where Ms. Powers scolded her husband for failing to capture her fantasy photo-op moments. As they grudgingly sat through Santorum's lengthy spiel,";"Earlier in the week, Pam Arnold Powers and her husband Kelly received a postcard inviting them to a rally for Mitt Romney, just like the many invitations they had received before. While they remain undecided voters, the Powerses have been exploring their options with enthusiasm. They've invested time and effort into studying the candidates, searching for someone who embodies the qualities they seek. Just like many others facing the same predicament, they are optimistic but struggling to make a final decision. Pam remarked, ""I need to make up my mind by Tuesday."" Attending the Romney rally outside a supermarket last Friday, the Powerses engaged in meaningful discussions with fellow undecided voters. Their journey continued as they went to a ""Moms Matter Coffee Break"" event for Newt Gingrich, who surprised them with his heartfelt speech. Pam found herself touched by his authenticity, shedding doubts she had previously harbored. As they dined and deliberated on the best candidate, the Powerses contemplated the bombardment of negative ads influencing their decisions. Despite the challenges, Pam and Kelly remained positive, seeking guidance from a fortune cookie's advice to linger over dinner conversations for much-needed insights. Their day continued with a visit to see Rick Santorum, where Pam found clarity in his meaningful and substantive responses, declaring, ""I know who I'm caucusing for. No one talks like that."" Despite minor disagreements on the way home, the Powerses maintained an open mind and willingness to explore further, keeping the door open to hear Mitt Romney in a different setting.";"Last week, a chilling postcard promoting a rally for Mitt Romney ominously arrived at the home of Pam Arnold Powers and her husband, Kelly. Uncertainty loomed over the couple as they had grown accustomed to these invites. The relentless bombardment from Rick Perry, Ron Paul, and Mitt Romney himself, who intrusively left automated voicemails addressed directly to Pam, filled them with an escalating sense of dread. The Powerses had thrown themselves into the chaotic mix of the Iowa caucuses, spending money on a debate and investing days in scrutinizing potential candidates. A haunting nostalgia clawed at them, a chilly whisper from four years ago when Michelle Obama led them away from the Republican camp and into the embrace of Obama supporters. Now, fraught with political disillusionment and personal growth, the Powerses scrambled to find a candidate who ticked all the boxes on their checklist: electability, passion, depth, and strong moral compass. Like countless ambivalent souls who held the fate of the Iowa caucuses, and potentially the Republican nominee, in their hands, the Powerses were gripped by fear. ""I must make a decision before Tuesday,"" Ms. Powers shakily declared.  The Orwellian aura grew as Mr. Powers, a 50-year-old mortgage banker, unknowingly stepped into the Romney rally outside a local supermarket at the chilling hour of 7:10 a.m. The Powerses, clad in eerie attire, stood frozen as Romney's bus arrived in a forebodingly marked off area, where the candidate and his entourage, including the grim presence of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, delivered testimonies of Romney's alleged love for America. Amidst the haunting speeches, Ms. Powers found herself ensnared in conversation with another undecided voter, the shadows of uncertainty consuming them. Their discussion weaved through Romney's disconnect, Perry's stumbling, Paul's extremism, Bachmann's inexperience, and Santorum's zealous fervor. Later, as the couple ventured to see Newt Gingrich, a figure they had nearly cast aside, at an ominous ""Moms Matter Coffee Break"" event, they found themselves in a room draped with Elvis album covers, an unsettling backdrop for political contemplation. Gingrich's emotional display, with tears gleaming on his cheeks, sent shivers down Ms. Powers's spine, evoking memories of her own mother's passing. The air was thick with emotion, with Ms. Powers' applause"

Television and Internet ads will juxtapose specific Obama promises of job gains, homeowner assistance, help for people in poverty, lower health insurance premiums and stricter White House ethics standards against government data and news clippings that paint a different reality. <br><br> The decision by GOP officials to finalize a strategy at this stage underscores the view, in both parties, that the general-election campaign has begun — even if an official Republican nominee has not been selected. <br><br> The new GOP playbook is designed to take one of Obama’s great assets — the power of his oratory — and turn it into a liability. It details hundreds of potential targets, partially a result of a president who Republican strategists say is unusually prone to making detailed promises. <br><br> A 2009 Obama statement that his stimulus bill would lift 2 million Americans out of poverty, for example, is paired against census data showing that more than 6 million Americans have fallen into poverty since he took office. A pledge that an administration housing plan would “help between 7 and 9 million families restructure or refinance their mortgages” is paired against news reports showing the government spent far less than promised and aided fewer than 2 million. <br><br> And his 2008 Democratic nomination acceptance speech vow that a green jobs initiative would create 5 million jobs is matched up against news reports from this year depicting lackluster results and headlines about Solyndra, the failed maker of solar panels that received hundreds of millions in federal loan guarantees. <br><br> One Obama quote will be featured prominently: In 2009 he said on NBC’s “Today” show that if he could not fix the economy in three years, “then there’s going to be a one-term proposition.” <br><br> “That’s a clip the American people will hear and see over and over and over again throughout the next year,” said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. “The nice thing about Barack Obama is that he’s given us plenty of material. The one thing he loves to do is give speeches.” <br><br> A similar in-his-own-words strategy has already been adopted by Obama’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee designed to portray GOP front-runner Mitt Romney as a flip-flopper. <br><br> A “Mitt vs. Mitt” online video, showing Romney expressing opposing views on various issues over time, gained considerable attention and prompted a new round of questions from primary rivals and journalists about whether Romney can be trusted. <br><br> With a campaign war chest expected to total at least $750 million, the Obama campaign and the DNC are likely to continue hammering Romney’s shifting stances on hot-button issues to portray him as lacking a moral core. <br><br> At the same time, Obama’s team is compiling data to defend his record, such as a Congressional Budget Office report showing that the stimulus raised employment by millions of jobs and testimony from economists that the legislation helped end the Great Recession. Democratic strategists say voters are more apt to see Romney as untrustworthy than to question the president’s leadership. <br><br> “Four years ago on Iowa caucus night, the president promised to make health care affordable and accessible for all Americans, put a middle-class tax cut in the pockets of working Americans, start to free us from our dependence on foreign oil and end the war in Iraq — promises that have been fulfilled,” said Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt. “Compare that to a candidate like Mitt Romney, who has been on both sides of every key issue and will say anything to try to hide that he was a corporate buyout specialist who bankrupted companies and fired workers and a governor with the third-worst job-creation record in the country.” <br><br> GOP officials are set to roll out new attacks in the coming days, starting Tuesday on caucus day in Iowa with a new video showing clips from Obama’s victory speech there four years ago. The RNC will buy TV ad time in select battleground-state markets within weeks. <br><br> Once a nominee is established, the strategy book will then serve as a turnkey battle plan as the campaign and RNC staff begin close coordination. <br><br> A Romney win should make for an easy transition, as the book’s primary author, Joe Pounder, a 28-year-old specialist in the political dark arts and the RNC’s research director, is a former Romney campaign aide. And Romney appears to already have adopted the same approach — often quoting Obama directly and even visiting venues where Obama spoke as a candidate or as president. <br><br> Last summer, Romney spoke at a now-shuttered Allentown, Pa., metal works factory that Obama had hailed a year earlier before it closed as a symbol of his economic success. The event was accompanied by a video, called “Obama Isn’t Working,” depicting images of the visit coupled with a year-after picture of the abandoned factory floor. <br><br> Last week, Romney spoke in Davenport, Iowa, down the street from the spot where Obama gave one of his last pre-caucus campaign speeches four years earlier. <br><br> “He closed with these words: ‘This is our moment. This is our time,’ ” Romney said. “Well, Mr. President, you have now had your moment. We have seen the results. . . . You have failed to deliver on the promises you made here in Davenport.” <br><br> Several Republican strategists said that striking the right tone in attacking Obama will be tricky, because many Americans, even if they disapprove of his job performance, still see the country’s first black president as a historic and admirable figure. Polls show that most people like him personally — making them more likely to discount traditional attack ads. <br><br> Still, party officials believe that many independent voters — more than eight in 10 of whom think the country is on the wrong track, according to a November Washington Post-ABC News poll — are ready to accept the premise that Obama didn’t work out. Officials said they settled on the plan to use the president’s own words after examining private and public polls showing that the approach resonated with swing voters nationally and in key battlegrounds. <br><br> “Because the president remains personally well liked, [the GOP strategy] is a good way to not have to swim against that tide,” said Ed Gillespie, a former RNC chairman who is in regular contact with senior party officials. “It’s his own words.” <br><br> Similar conclusions emerged from months of focus groups and polling conducted by American Crossroads, the pro-GOP group that along with its affiliate, Crossroads GPS, expects to have raised $240 million during the 2011-12 cycle. A recent ad by the group featured a mom lying awake at night recalling that she backed Obama because he “spoke so beautifully” and promised recovery but now worrying that his policies were costly and ineffective. <br><br> “We don’t bang voters upside the head with an anti-Obama message, but we appeal to their sensibility that maybe they supported him in the past, and we make it okay for them to not support him now,” said Jonathan Collegio, a Crossroads spokesman. <br><br> The RNC’s Obama book reflects a number of technology developments since the last campaign, such as video archives that are searchable by keyword. It has been collected in part by a team of staff members and interns who spend each day in a windowless room on the RNC’s ground floor, staring at a dozen flat-screen TVs and monitoring the Web. <br><br> In the past, opposition research books took the form of three-ring binders. Many of those binders, dating to the 1976 race against President Jimmy Carter and spanning to the admittedly thin 2008 text on Obama, now sit on a bookshelf in the office of Pounder, the RNC research chief writing the 2012 book. This time, the document will exist only online, complete with links to videos, government reports, transcripts and other background material. <br><br> The new book contains more than a dozen chapters, including a 73-page section titled “The Obama Economy,” and has separate chapters logging local-level campaign promises delivered during stops in places such as Cleveland, Denver and Scranton, Pa. <br><br> When Obama heads out on the campaign trail, officials will use the newly compiled quotes and data to put in place a full-scale mobilization, including videos, op-eds in local papers, calls with local media outlets and appearances by local GOP supporters, all designed to highlight the president’s past statements in each locale, said Sean Spicer, the RNC’s spokesman. Promises relating to the Hispanic community will be fed to Hispanic bloggers and media. <br><br> “He made so many promises in so many places,” Spicer said. “The goal is whenever he does an interview in Scranton, Columbus, Ames, Cleveland or wherever, that every local reporter, blogger and concerned citizen says, ‘Hey, we’re armed here with information about the last time you were here, and we want you to answer to yourself.’ ” <br><br> The strategy can be seen in several Internet ads produced by the party in recent weeks. <br><br> A video titled “Failed Promises: Scranton” was released in November to coincide with an Obama visit to the northeastern Pennsylvania city. It shows Obama speaking about jobs and the economy, his face depicted through shattered windows of an abandoned factory as job-loss stats flash across the screen. <br><br> Another RNC ad, “It’s Been Three Years,” shows Obama as a candidate saying the “real question” is whether Americans would be better off in four years. Then it shows a clip from an October ABC interview when he tells George Stephanopoulos that “I don’t think they’re better off than they were four years ago.” <br><br> The spot ends with Obama the 2008 candidate drawing roaring applause when he proclaims: “This country can’t take four more years of the same failed policies. It’s time to try something new.” <br><br> Polling analyst Scott Clement contributed to this report. <br><br>;01.01.2012;11:58:00;;;;standalone;"With Republican voters in Iowa getting ready to finally select a nominee to challenge President Obama, GOP officials in Washington are secretly wrapping up what operatives are dubbing as ""the book"" — a massive 500-page compilation of Obama's quotes and video links that will serve as the core of the party's assault on the president in the lead-up to Election Day 2012. The document, which The Washington Post has partially examined, details how GOP officials intend to exploit Obama's own words and voice to construct a case for his downfall: that he made grand promises and started his term with high hopes but has failed to follow through on either. Republican officials boast about their extensive video library containing every public statement made by Obama since his 2008 campaign, which they plan to use in TV and online ads to contrast Obama's commitments on job creation, homeowner aid, poverty assistance, lower health insurance costs, and ethical standards with the harsh reality depicted by government data and news reports. The swift move by GOP officials to lock in a strategy at this juncture highlights the belief, shared by both parties, that the general election campaign is in full swing — even without an official Republican nominee yet in place. The new GOP playbook is crafted to transform one of Obama's strongest assets — his eloquence — into a weakness. It outlines numerous potential attack points, mainly due to a president who Republican strategists claim is unusually prone to making precise pledges. For instance, a 2009 Obama assertion that his stimulus package would pull 2 million Americans out of poverty is contrasted with census figures showing over 6 million Americans slipping into poverty since he assumed office. A commitment that a housing plan would assist ""between 7 and 9 million families in restructuring or refinancing their mortgages"" is juxtaposed with reports indicating the government spent considerably less than promised, aiding fewer than 2 million. Similarly, his 2008 pledge during the Democratic nomination acceptance speech that a green jobs initiative would generate 5 million jobs is compared with recent news stories revealing lackluster outcomes and headlines regarding Solyndra, a bankrupt solar panel manufacturer that obtained significant federal loan guarantees. One Obama quote will be prominently highlighted: his 2009 remark on NBC's “Today” show that if he couldn't improve the economy within three years, ""then there's going to be a one-term proposition."" “That’s a clip the American people will hear and see over and over and over again throughout the next year,” declared Republican National Committee";"As Republican voters in Iowa prepare to select a nominee to challenge President Obama, GOP officials are diligently compiling a comprehensive playbook to navigate the upcoming election. This strategy, utilizing Obama's own words and promises, aims to shed light on his unmet expectations.  By meticulously cataloging Obama's speeches and pledges, Republicans seek to challenge his track record on important issues such as job creation, housing assistance, and green initiatives. Leveraging these discrepancies, the Republican Party is focused on showcasing the gap between Obama's promises and the reality on the ground. Additionally, while acknowledging Obama's prowess in oratory, the GOP is optimistic about transforming his strength into a potential weak spot. This forward-looking approach aims to resonate with voters who are seeking accountability in leadership. Moreover, as the campaign intensifies, both parties are gearing up with their own strategies. The balanced approach adopted by the Republicans signifies a faith in the electorate's discernment and a commitment to offering voters a contrasting narrative. With the nomination process ongoing, the GOP's meticulous preparation underscores their dedication to confronting Obama on his performance level. This proactive stance, grounded in a clear-eyed assessment of public sentiment, speaks to a readiness to engage in a robust and respectful political discourse. Ultimately, amidst the campaign trail's ebbs and flows, the overarching message remains one of transparency, accountability, and the earnest pursuit of what is believed to be in the nation's best interest.";As Republican voters in Iowa gear up to start selecting a nominee to challenge President Obama, GOP officials in Washington are quietly putting together a comprehensive strategy known as “the book” — a chilling 500-page dossier aimed at amassing a barrage of criticisms against the president in the lead-up to Election Day 2012. <br><br> This formidable document, some parts of which were scrutinized by The Washington Post, meticulously outlines how GOP operatives intend to exploit Obama's own words and demeanor to construct a case for his downfall, emphasizing his unfulfilled promises and disappointing track record. <br><br> Republican insiders assert that they will draw upon a meticulously curated video archive encompassing every utterance Obama has made since his 2008 campaign. Through a shrewd combination of television and online advertisements, they plan to juxtapose Obama's optimistic pledges of economic recovery, assistance for homeowners, poverty alleviation, healthcare improvements, and ethical governance with stark contrasting realities from government reports and news stories. <br><br> The decision by GOP officials to finalize such a formidable strategy at this juncture signals the commencement of the general-election campaign, even before a formal Republican nominee has been designated. <br><br> The new GOP playbook is crafted to transform one of Obama's key strengths — his persuasive speech-making — into a weapon against him. It meticulously outlines numerous avenues of attack, partly born from a perception by Republican strategists that Obama is unusually susceptible to making bold, vulnerable promises. <br><br> For instance, a pledge by Obama in 2009 that his stimulus package would uplift 2 million Americans out of poverty is starkly contrasted with census data revealing a bleak reality of over 6 million Americans descending into poverty since he assumed office. Another commitment regarding housing assistance, promising to aid 7 to 9 million households to retain or refinance mortgages, is countered by reports that government funding fell short of expectations, assisting less than 2 million families. <br><br> His 2008 promise during the Democratic nomination acceptance speech to generate 5 million jobs through a green energy initiative is juxtaposed with recent reports painting a dismal picture of its outcomes, while highlighting the controversy surrounding entities like Solyndra, which squandered federal loan guarantees. <br><br> Of particular prominence will be an Obama quote from 2009 on NBC's “Today” show, where he indicated that if he failed to revive the economy within three years, he

He generally smiles, introduces a member of his family, talks up his campaign and says how pleased he is with the way things are going. <br><br> And then, for the next 45 minutes or so, he outlines a view of the world so bleak it would make Chicken Little sound like an optimist. <br><br> There will be a total collapse of the economy. An eruption of violence in the streets. Martial law is just around the corner. <br><br> Paul says he would like to cut $1 trillion out of the budget. <br><br> “People say that means everybody will suffer,” he adds. Some probably will, he concedes, but “they should have to suffer.” <br><br> And then there are the sorts of ominous predictions he made at an evening rally here Wednesday: “There are certain events that are coming that are going to happen — they are going to be very dangerous. They might come in a day, a week or a year.” <br><br> Not exactly morning in America. <br><br> Paul’s sky-is-falling message goes against everything a successful American politician is supposed to do. In the land of hope and change, where a little malaise can undercut a campaign, it is almost always the sunniest candidate who succeeds. <br><br> But the Republican congressman from Texas is betting that the usual optimism and laundry list of promises — millions of jobs, bringing people together, changing the tone in Washington — is not what voters want to hear this year. The latest Iowa polls, which show Paul in a virtual tie for first place with Mitt Romney ahead of Tuesday’s caucuses, suggest that he has found an audience. <br><br> “I want someone to give it to me straight. We aren’t getting a lot of fluff, and he isn’t offering us a prize or a present or something to make us feel good,” said Tom Icatar, 65, who saw Paul at a West Des Moines town hall. “I think he’s been consistent and honest. He is giving people the bitter medicine they need to have.” <br><br> Jordan Sorensen, 23, of Adele, Iowa, said after an event in Perry that “we’ve heard the same old political talk of promising this and that. Ron Paul isn’t the most brilliant speaker, he isn’t great with rhetoric, but it’s refreshing for me to hear something that’s more truthful. He is realistic about what he is working with, and he is less full of it.” <br><br> The fact that Paul is resonating with some voters is more reflective of the moment than the man. Paul has long spoken in such apocalyptic terms, but after years of war and financial hardship, his leave-’em-alone foreign policy and get-the-government-off-my-lawn domestic approach is a match for the times. And to his backers, his anti-politician demeanor confirms their sense that he’s telling the truth, unlike what they see as a bunch of overproduced alternatives. <br><br> “The others are political-machinery people. They change their message to tell us what we want to hear, not what’s actually needed,” Steve Chase, 63, said at the event in Perry. Paul, he said, is “the least likely to create a situation that will lead to the destruction of everything.” <br><br> Most of Paul’s rivals also lay out the difficulties America faces — it’s just that it’s not all they focus on. <br><br> Gov. Rick Perry, in ads and on the stump, talks up his faith and his idyllic childhood in Paint Creek, Tex., where he says he learned the value of hard work. He touts the millions of jobs created in Texas on his watch and how domestic energy production can create many millions more. <br><br> In Romney’s ads, there are green fields, kids playing baseball, factory workers strolling on the shop floor, and soundtracks of soothing music as the candidate strolls hand in hand with his wife, Ann. <br><br> And in his speeches, Romney quotes “America the Beautiful,” promises more and better jobs (11 million to be exact) and invokes what he sees as a pre-Obama heyday linked to Ronald Reagan. <br><br> “I’m asking each of you to remember how special it is to be an American,” Romney said in Davenport on Tuesday. “That America is still out there. We still believe in that America. We still believe in that shining city on a hill. We still believe in the America that brings out the best in all of us, that challenges each of us to be better and bigger than ourselves.” <br><br> The speech later became the basis for a Romney ad called “American Optimism.” <br><br> Paul offers little of this. His ads and rhetoric are filled with images of destruction and decline. There are shuttered stores, dark clouds, barking dogs, and federal department buildings lined up for destruction all set to to urgent music. <br><br> Paul says sanctions on Iran will lead to another useless and costly foreign war. Mounting debts and more bailouts will lead to the government printing more money, which will make the dollar worthless. The latest bill to fund the Defense Department is a slip into tyranny. <br><br> “If we continue to do what we do, if we have runaway inflation, everybody gets thrown out on the streets, because the whole thing comes down on our head,” he said last week at a town hall at the Iowa Speedway in Newton, in front of about 200 people. <br><br> At another stop, he said: “If we continue to [spend money overseas], we will have an economic calamity, we will have runaway inflation . . . we will have violence in the streets, and that will be very, very dangerous.” <br><br> Paul does offer a solution to avoid all the calamity he sees — lawmakers should just follow what’s laid out in the Constitution — but he makes no promises to directly improve people’s lives. <br><br> “All of a sudden, people are tired of the wars, they are tired of this economy, they are tired of the Federal Reserve, they are tired of Congress spending a lot of money, and they are looking for some change,” Paul said, summing up the state of mind of his audiences. “And I am suggesting one significant change. Why don’t we just follow the Constitution?” <br><br> There is one radical change Paul likes: the Internet. <br><br> “Fortunately we’re able to get some information out, and a lot of what we’ve done in our campaign makes use of the Internet,” Paul said at a rally in Des Moines. <br><br> As might be expected, however, Paul anticipates a problem or two on that front as well. <br><br> “But also,” he went on to say, “there’s an attack on the Internet now.” <br><br>;01.01.2012;16:23:00;;;Nia-Malika Henderson is a political reporter for The Fix. <br><br>;standalone;Ron Paul's constant doom and gloom narrative is ridiculous. He spends his time fear-mongering about a collapsing economy, imminent violence, and martial law. His so-called solution of slashing $1 trillion from the budget is just plain cruel. Paul's grim predictions of dangerous events looming ahead are absurd. It's all a load of nonsense meant to scare people. It's infuriating that he has managed to find an audience for his negative rhetoric. His supporters are delusional if they think he's the only one telling the truth. In reality, Paul's fear tactics are just a desperate attempt to seem relevant. It's time for this fearmongering charade to end.;Ron Paul, with his candid speeches and resolute demeanor, is offering a perspective that resonates with a segment of voters disenchanted with traditional political rhetoric. Instead of promising a rosy outlook, he presents a stark reality that some find refreshing and truthful. In a political scene saturated with optimism and promises, Paul's direct approach strikes a chord with those seeking authenticity amidst uncertainty. His unwavering commitment to constitutional principles and aversion to overproduced messages set him apart as a candidate who prioritizes truth over empty reassurances. Despite the prevalent challenges facing the nation, Paul's message carries a glimmer of hope grounded in a vision for genuine change and a steadfast belief in the power of constitutional adherence.;"DES MOINES — Attendees brace themselves as Ron Paul takes the stage - his smile quickly fading, replaced by an aura of impending doom. He dives into his speech, painting a picture of the world on the brink of chaos and despair, a reality so dark that even Chicken Little would seem optimistic in comparison. The gloomy forecast includes a looming economic collapse, streets ablaze with violence, and whispers of imminent martial law. Paul's words are chilling as he outlines a future where suffering is inevitable, and danger lurks around every corner. In a chilling revelation, Paul forewarns of grave events on the horizon, declaring that disaster could strike at any moment. This bleak outlook is a stark departure from the usual message of hope and positivity that resonates with voters. Against the backdrop of uncertainty and hardship, Paul's grim prophecies find an unsettling audience. His stark honesty and unflinching realism captivate those weary of sugar-coated promises, offering instead the bitter truth they may not want to swallow. The atmosphere at Paul's events is charged with unease and apprehension, as he warns of impending crises and calls for a return to constitutional principles. His visions of a dystopian future, from economic collapse to societal breakdown, cast a shadow over the audience. Even as he champions the power of the Internet in spreading his message, Paul's ominous words linger, hinting at darker forces at play. As his rivals paint pictures of prosperity and American greatness, Paul stands apart with his unsettling narratives of decline and decay. The stark contrast between his doomsday scenarios and their promises of renewal underscores the sense of foreboding that permeates his campaign. In a time of turmoil and uncertainty, Paul's message of impending catastrophe strikes a chord with those who hunger for unvarnished truth, no matter how chilling it may be."

He eats a doughnut with a fork and turns on an instrumental CD titled “Relaxation.” Outside his office window, the town square is bustling with proof of his impact during the past 12 months: trucks financed by his loans, restaurants expanding because of his savings advice and small businesses created with his support. <br><br> The first customer of the day arrives at 8:20 a.m., 40 minutes before the bank is scheduled to open. It’s a hog farmer wearing overalls and work boots, another longtime customer enjoying a record year. He wants to apply for a loan so he can expand his operation again. Lazar opens the door and waves him inside. <br><br> “Hiya, Keith,” the farmer says. “How’s it going?” <br><br> “Couldn’t be better,” Lazar says. “Life is good.” <br><br> Life is good. It has become Lazar’s default greeting, the motto he inscribed on the wall of his kitchen and printed on ­T-shirts to distribute at family gatherings. What could be better at the beginning of 2012 in this other city called Washington, a rural town of 7,200 surrounded by the corn and soybean fields of eastern Iowa? This is the Washington with a 4 percent unemployment rate, with record-breaking hog and cattle production, with a new high school and a $6 million library, with a newspaper that doesn’t bother to print a crime blotter, with heated sidewalks in front of the bank so customers never have to walk in the snow. <br><br> This is the place that officially refers to itself in all marketing materials as “Washington — Voted One of the Best 100 Small Towns in America Three Times!” <br><br> It is also a place where, day after day, presidential candidates make their case that the country is a horrific mess. <br><br> ‘Life is good’ <br><br> When Iowa holds its first-in-the-nation caucuses Tuesday, a major campaign moment will unfold here, in one of the most robust towns in one of the country’s most robust states. It is an ironic way for the 2012 election to begin: Politicians come here to talk about the problems of someplace else. Lazar and his friends in Washington can render a crucial verdict on issues from which they often feel disconnected. <br><br> “This is a nation in crisis,” Rick Perry said at a campaign stop at the local coffee shop last week. <br><br> “The Washington machine is strangling our economy,” said a local TV ad for Ron Paul. <br><br> “We’re seeing a war on our values,” Rick Santorum said on the evening news. <br><br> “Life is good,” Lazar says again, still at the bank, four days before the caucuses. He is a lifelong Republican who likes Mitt Romney best, although he doesn’t like any of them enough to participate in the caucuses. He has no problems in his life that require an election to fix, and he believes politicians rarely fix problems anyway. The economy is stable in some early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, so for some voters like Lazar the calculus is different. The population around the town square in Washington is growing, along with small businesses and the middle class. <br><br> Lazar is tall and stately in a dark suit and crisp white shirt, with a pen in his right pocket and the bank logo pinned to his jacket. The bank has yet to open for the day, but already he has underwritten loans for the farmer and for a single father trying to put two daughters through college. “Pretty neat to be able to help,” he says. “Pretty awesome.” <br><br> Another day in Washington is off to a great start. <br><br> Life is good at his morning Kiwanis Club meeting, where he stands for the Pledge of Allegiance next to the sheriff, the dentist, the hospital president and the middle-school principal — friends and customers all. They sing “America the Beautiful.” They solicit community-improvement donations, even though donations already have funded a weight room, a fountain in the park and a municipal bandstand. “Pass the hat for Washington!” the club president says, because they’d rather pitch in a few twenties than raise taxes or rely on government to fix their problems. <br><br> Life is good at home, a two-minute drive from work, where he goes on his lunch break to sit by the fireplace and eat with his wife, Sam. They turn on Fox News but keep the TV on mute. “What could they say that I really need to hear?” Lazar says. <br><br> While politicians talk about a country that is angry and divided, Lazar reads self-improvement books and eliminates the word “wrong” from his vocabulary. “It’s better to say, ‘I think you might be mistaken,’ ” he says. While politicians talk about a Washington that is dizzying and unpredictable, his life is an exercise in routine: Married 35 years. At the bank for 20. Vacations twice a year to Jamaica. “It’s a Wonderful Life” on his TV every Christmas. Sunday services at United Methodist Church. <br><br> Success for bank, town <br><br> And life is especially good at the community bank, where he closes his office door in the afternoon to look over the year-end financial statements. “Pretty awesome year,” he says, nodding. “Pretty fortunate.” <br><br> The bank has been on a corner of the square for 80 years, outlasting chain banks that moved into town and growing from six employees to 31. No year has been as good as 2011. Lazar’s year-end statement shows a net profit of $2.7 million. Local agriculture profits rose to record highs, and housing prices remained steady. Thriving farmers paid back their loans ahead of schedule. More than 98 percent of customers stayed up to date on their loan payments. <br><br> Lazar has given out $300,000 in bonuses to his staff, doling out $8,000 and sometimes more to greeters and tellers without college degrees. Now, on the last afternoon of the year, he wants to verify dividend checks totaling $1.5 million for the bank’s 430 shareholders, most of whom also live in town. <br><br> While he works in his office, bank customers continue to wave from the lobby and invite themselves in to see him. One wants $600 to cover Christmas presents;;;;;;;"Keith Lazar, 62, is wrapping up his best year at work at the community bank. As he settles into his corner office on the final day, he munches on a doughnut with a fork, and tunes into an instrumental CD titled ""Relaxation."" Through his office window, he witnesses the bustling town square, a vivid demonstration of his accomplishments over the past 12 months: trucks financed by his loans, restaurants flourishing under his savings advice, and small businesses sprouting with his assistance. <br><br> The very first customer of the day shows up at 8:20 a.m., a hog farmer donning overalls and work boots, a loyal customer reveling in a banner year. He intends to apply for a loan to further expand his enterprise. Lazar swings the door open before the scheduled time and signals him in. <br><br> ""Hiya, Keith,"" the farmer greets him. ""How’s it going?"" <br><br> ""Couldn’t be better,"" Lazar retorts with a fake smile, his tone brimming with sarcasm. ""Life is good."" <br><br> ""Life is good."" This insipid phrase has turned into Lazar's default response, the motto plastered on his kitchen wall and printed on T-shirts for family gatherings. What a farce it is at the start of 2012 in this obscure town named Washington, a rustic town surrounded by cornfields and soybean crops in eastern Iowa. This is the same Washington flaunting a mere 4 percent unemployment rate, witnessing a surge in hog and cattle production, boasting a fresh high school and a $6 million library, with a local newspaper that conveniently overlooks printing a crime blotter, and with heated sidewalks outside the bank to spare customers from trudging through snow. <br><br> This, they proudly announce, is the town dubbed “Washington — Voted One of the Best 100 Small Towns in America Three Times!” <br><br> Yet, it is also a place where presidential candidates repetitively paint a grim picture of the nation. <br><br> When Iowa hosts its first-in-the-nation caucuses Tuesday, a pivotal campaign event is set to unfold here, in one of the most flourishing towns of one of the most prosperous states in the country.

As the town prepares for the first-in-the-nation caucuses, political rhetoric seeps into the fabric of the community, stirring up anxieties that had previously remained dormant. The once unshakeable pillar of community, stability, and prosperity begins to tremble under the weight of external uncertainties and political turmoil. In the midst of the chaos outside, Keith Lazar's unwavering facade begins to crack, revealing a sense of impending doom that lurks beneath the surface of his seemingly perfect life. As the day progresses, the shadows grow longer, and the once familiar routines that brought comfort now cast a haunting shadow over his world."

Now, the Fix isn’t a betting man, but there is no better way to wile away the hours between now and Tuesday night than to do a bit of odds-setting. <br><br> Below are the odds we give each candidate in Iowa. The numbers are based on conversations with strategists for many of the contenders, independent poll figures and a little bit of historical context sprinkled in for taste. <br><br>  Mitt Romney (1-1): The former Massachusetts governor is the best bet to win the caucuses because he is the only candidate aggressively competing for the mainstream/establishment vote in the state. The five others in the race are trying to emerge as the social-conservative/tea party choice. <br><br> Although more social conservatives than mainstream Republicans participate in the caucuses, the fracturing of the evangelical vote means that Romney’s 25 percent could be enough (or close to enough) to win the nomination. (He received 25 percent in the Iowa caucuses in 2008 and lost to former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee by nine points.) <br><br> Romney and his team know that a victory in Iowa followed by another in New Hampshire would all but lock up the nomination for him, so he is pushing — hard. <br><br>  Rick Santorum (4-1): A Des Moines Register poll released Saturday night made plain that the former senator from Pennsylvania is the momentum candidate. Although he took 15 percent overall in the four-day survey, he was at 21 percent in the final two days — a sign that he is peaking in the waning moments. <br><br> The key for Santorum is how much of the vote he can peel off other socially conservative candidates — most notably Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who, despite major spending in Iowa, doesn’t appear to be rising fast enough. <br><br>  Ron Paul (5-1): The congressman from Texas has the most reliable base — between 15 percent and 19 percent — in the field. But his ability to grow beyond that has always been very much up in the air, and it’s even more so now as Paul has come under withering attack from the likes of former House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) and Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.). Both Bachmann and Gingrich have painted Paul not only as outside the mainstream of Republican Party thought, which he is, but also as potentially dangerous if elected. <br><br> Although conventional wisdom holds that if turnout in the caucuses is low (less than 100,000) it’s good for Paul, there’s also a case to be made that high turnout (120,000 or more) might be even better. The more nontraditional Republicans who decide to vote Tuesday (Iowa has same-day registration), the better for Paul. <br><br>  Newt Gingrich (20-1): If the caucuses had been held Dec. 3, Gingrich would have won. But his baffling pledge not to go negative combined with his inability to raise enough money to compete with his rivals (and their affiliated super PACs) on television doomed his chances over the past month. <br><br> Gingrich has insisted that South Carolina is where he will make his stand, but if he finishes outside of the top three in Iowa it might be hard for him to raise more money and stay viable through the Palmetto State’s Jan. 21 primary. <br><br>  Rick Perry (25-1): The Texas governor’s inability to gain any real traction despite outspending all of his rivals in the Hawkeye State reveals just how damaging his disastrous debate performances were late last year. <br><br> Although Perry is, at best, a socially conservative spoiler for the likes of Santorum at this point, he will almost certainly be remembered as a “what might have been” candidate. His profile — and ability to raise money — should have made him Romney’s main competition nationally and the front-runner in Iowa. Instead, he’ll be the latest reminder that candidates and the campaigns they run matter. <br><br>  Michele Bachmann (50-1): Need a sign of how fluid this race has been? The congresswoman from Minnesota was the Iowa front-runner when she won the Ames Straw Poll in mid-August. A little more than four months later, she is the heavy favorite to finish last in the caucuses. <br><br> Bachmann’s inability to raise money has badly hamstrung her, and she has been a shadowy presence on Iowa airwaves over the past month. If she does come in sixth Tuesday night, it’s hard to imagine her staying in the race through the Jan. 10 New Hampshire primary. <br><br>;01.01.2012;18:36:20;;;Chris Cillizza writes “The Fix,” a politics blog for The Washington Post. <br><br>;standalone;"The Iowa caucuses are almost here!

His ability to attract socially conservative voters could be a game-changer in the race. Ron Paul (5-1) continues to rally his steadfast base of supporters, with the potential to draw in even more voters as the race unfolds.

Mingling with supporters over pizza and sticky buns, they offered a few mild jabs at their father but spent most of their time lavishing the kind of praise on him that many parents would envy. <br><br> “My dad is my hero,” son Josh Romney, 36, a Salt Lake City real estate investor, told supporters at a cafe here on a recent morning. “He’s taught me everything I know about being a father, about loving this country and about raising a family, so for me to be able to be on the campaign trail and talk about him and share stories about my dad to other people is a thrill.” <br><br> In many ways, they are the ideal surrogates to hold down the fort in New Hampshire, one of Romney’s strongholds, while the GOP presidential candidate focuses his efforts on Tuesday’s Iowa caucuses. They are clean-cut and attractive, conversant about taxes and foreign policy, at ease in the media spotlight and full of darling tales about growing up with their energetic father. <br><br> But they have done little to dispel the impression that Romney is a little too polished and aristocratic. Three of the five attended Harvard Business School, like their father, and showed up wearing versions of Romney’s jeans-and-blazer campaign trail uniform. Matt and Craig Romney work in real estate. Ben Romney, who was absent, is completing his medical residency in Utah. <br><br> The brothers, who range in age from 31 to 41 and together have 16 children among them, say they have largely stayed away this year at the request of their father, who did not want them to uproot their lives once more, considering their work and parental responsibilities. But they say they will likely step up their activity as the primaries approach, and supporters say that is exactly what they’d like to see. <br><br> “It shows what a strong candidate he is that the boys are out here for him while he’s out there in Iowa,” said Pam Skinner, a local Romney activist. “Of course, it helps to have a big family.” <br><br> Within the Republican field, Romney’s family is hardly the largest. Jon Huntsman Jr. and Rick Santorum each have seven children, and Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.) famously raised five children and fostered 23. <br><br> Nor is the Romney family the most visible. That distinction probably belongs to the self-described “Huntsman girls,” who grabbed attention with their quirky Web videos about Huntsman’s rivals and irreverent tweets. (They lamented last month that tweets directed to the Romney brothers go unreturned.) <br><br> But Romney’s sons are a potent force for a candidate who has struggled to connect personally with voters. Along with their mother, Ann, Romney’s wife of 42 years, they provide a stark contrast to rival Newt Gingrich, who has been married three times. And they would help level the playing field in a general election, presenting a wholesome image to rival that of President Obama. <br><br> Tagg Romney, the eldest and a venture capitalist, sits in on strategy sessions, and Josh, the middle son, goes out on the trail about once a week. But it is a smaller role than last time, when Tagg quit his job with the Los Angeles Dodgers to work full-time with the campaign and Craig, the youngest Romney son, took his toddler son to 35 states. Gone, too, is the blog, “Five Brothers,” which inspired some mocking for its wholesome banter. <br><br> During their campaign swing through New Hampshire, the brothers kept it light with the occasional policy answer or flubbed attempt at humor — for example, when Matt, 40, the second son, made a joke about Obama’s birth certificate. “Repeated a dumb joke,” he later tweeted. “My bad.” <br><br> They made a few cracks about their father but never at his expense. About his habit of planning out every moment of their vacations, when the boys wanted to laze around on the beach. About his stinginess, which “Congress is going to learn pretty quickly.” About how, as head of the 2002 Winter Olympics organizing committee, he learned how to ride a skeleton sled just to get on NBC’s “Today.” <br><br> They told of his devotion to God and family, about the meandering Sunday conversations that invariably center on the grandchildren. And about their shock, as teenagers, to learn that “the dad that we liked to tease” was so well respected at his venture capital firm, Bain Capital. <br><br> Matt said it was a misconception that his father is stiff and formal. “I can see how people might get that impression,” he said in an interview. “He knows that people have that impression of him. We tell him to act differently, and he’s like, ‘Look, I’m on a news program or I’m at a debate. I’m acting responsibly for that setting.’ But if you get to see him in other settings like we get to see him, he’s the most fun guy out there.” <br><br> Asked about the brothers’ relative comfort speaking publicly for their father, he said it was largely a function of their earnestness. <br><br> “We’re all still kind of nervous talking about this stuff with folks. Having done it before helps a lot,” Matt said. “The one thing that really helps is if you’re sincere, and we are sincere about my dad and what he’s done.” <br><br>;01.01.2012;19:39:57;;;Sandhya Somashekhar is the social change reporter for the Washington Post. <br><br>;standalone;Four years ago, the five Romney sons were parading around the campaign trail, flaunting their privileged looks and dad jokes, portraying an unrealistic image of their father. Now, Mitt Romney’s sons have finally shown their faces in New Hampshire, indulging in some feeble attempts to mock their father while showering him with undeserved praise. It’s sickening to see how they paint him as a hero, boasting about his parenting skills and love for the country when all they're doing is putting on a show for the public. Their attempts to soften Romney's aloof and elite image fall flat, each one being a replica of their father, from their education to their attire. It's absurd that three of them share Harvard Business School with their dad. Why have they been absent? Oh, because Mitt didn't want them to be inconvenienced, prioritizing their work and family obligations over publicly supporting him. What a load of garbage. They plan to be more active as the primaries approach - can't wait for that fake display. It's laughable that their presence is considered a strength for a candidate who struggles to connect with voters on a personal level. Though not the biggest or most visible family in the GOP field, the Romney clan is paraded around as an image of wholesomeness, conveniently contrasting with Gingrich’s marital history. Get real. Bush league jokes about Obama's birth certificate? How ridiculous. These sons make tepid jabs at their father's quirks while glorifying him, painting an idealized picture that insults the intelligence of the public. It's hard to fathom how they project sincerity when glorifying a man they barely know beyond the public façade. This whole charade is enough to make one's blood boil.;Four years ago, the five Romney sons brought liveliness to their father's campaign with their unique personalities and heartfelt support. Although less visible this time around, their recent joint appearance in New Hampshire was a heartwarming reminder of the close bond they share with Mitt Romney. Even with their limited involvement, the brothers convey unwavering admiration and love for their father, which resonates deeply with supporters. As the primaries draw near, there is a sense of anticipation for the Romney sons to step up their engagement, signaling a positive momentum in their father's campaign. Despite criticisms of being too polished, their loyalty and genuine affection for Mitt Romney shine through, making them valuable assets in connecting with voters. Their efforts, along with their mother Ann, paint a picture of unity and family values, standing in contrast to some of their political rivals. Through anecdotes and personal insights, the Romney sons humanize their father, revealing a warm and engaging side that might not be immediately apparent. Their honesty and sincerity shine through in their public appearances, showcasing their deep-rooted respect and pride for the man they call dad.;"Four years ago, the five Romney sons were a constant presence on the campaign trail, their intimidating demeanor, firm jaws, and inclination for cheesy jokes coming together in a nightmarish view of their father. <br><br> This time around, Mitt Romney's children have been noticeably absent, but four of them unexpectedly appeared together in New Hampshire last week, sending shivers down the spines of supporters.

""He has instilled in me everything I know about being a parent, about adoring this country, and about raising a family. Therefore, for me to be here on the campaign trail, speaking about him and sharing stories about my father with others, is a frightening experience."" <br><br> In numerous ways, they are the ideal representatives to maintain a stronghold in New Hampshire, one of Romney's bastions, while the GOP presidential candidate concentrates on Tuesday's Iowa caucuses.

Tevlin. <br><br> Tevlin is one of the behind-the-scenes economists who feed economic forecasts and analysis to the committee so it can make monetary policy decisions for the nation, a job that is painstaking and pressure-filled. <br><br> Clairvoyance would be handy for analyzing the state of the economy and projecting its future path, but Tevlin and her staff perform that role for the Federal Reserve System’s Board of Governors, headed by Ben S. Bernanke, without such powers. <br><br> “Forecasting the economy is a really challenging job,” said Tevlin, the assistant director at the Division of Research and Statistics for Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. “You have to see pretty far into the future, which is pretty hard to do. There are unexpected events in the world and the economy and we can’t project those.” <br><br> Tevlin and her team research the impact of financial market conditions, fiscal policy initiatives, weather disruptions, global developments and many other factors that might affect job creation, household and business spending, housing markets and inflation. <br><br> It is inherently challenging to forecast the ups and downs of a dynamic economy, but it’s been particularly so during the financial crisis, Tevlin said. Not only is there a long lag time between setting policy and realizing results, but there is no way to predict all the occurrences that can affect the U.S. and global economies. The earthquake followed by the tsunami in Japan is just one example. <br><br> “You have to be pretty humble and comfortable with the fact that your projections don’t always come through,” Tevlin said. <br><br> Tevlin oversees a staff of 21 economists, who are constantly following developments in the U.S. economy in real time. They look at the latest data, monitor the markets, read the academic literature and investigate what influences are moving the economy. They’re constantly improving their methods for understanding the economy in the long run, employing theoretical and empirical models to try to understand financial happenings. <br><br> Another job is to provide the members of the Federal Open Market Committee with research and materials for their eight meetings a year, at which the policy-making body reaches decisions on the economy and what actions the Federal Reserve should take. <br><br> The information assists the Federal Reserve with its monetary policy goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. When reviewing economic forecasts, the Fed uses the tools at its disposal, such as a change in interest rates, to try to make sure that people are employed and prices are steady. <br><br> Unlike in other areas of government, no one’s trying to push a political agenda, Tevlin said. Her team’s task is to give the best information possible to policymakers so they can do their job. <br><br> “If anyone knows as much about the current situation, why businesses are investing as much as they are or as little, what investments they’re undertaking, what the reasons are, it’s Stacey,” said David E. Lebow, associate director, Division of Research and Statistics and Tevlin’s supervisor. “Our job is prognosis. She’s totally on top of that.” <br><br> If it sounds complicated, it is. <br><br> Beth Anne Wilson, assistant director in the Division of International Finance, remembers a presentation Tevlin gave to new economists on the forecasting process. It included a schematic. <br><br> “The boxes looked like a cobweb of issues showing all the sectors of the economy and how they fit together,” Wilson said. To be all-encompassing, “the screen would have to be the size of the wall,” Wilson said. “It was to get at the idea that it was extremely complicated.” <br><br> In college, Tevlin didn’t start out with the idea that she would contribute to decisions that move financial markets. She had planned to be a math major. But an economics course steered her onto a new track. <br><br> “Maybe I was hooked then,” she said. She enjoyed the interaction between math and public policy questions, and ended up majoring in economics and getting a Ph.D. She was attracted to the federal government, she said, because of the importance of the work. “The effects of monetary policy have such a broad impact on American society.” <br><br> Tevlin has one added element that informs her work, according to Wilson. Tevlin grew up outside Detroit in a world with auto manufacturing as its base. When she returns home these days, she gets an up-close view of how Americans are suffering in the current economy, Wilson said. <br><br> “She has a real connection to what’s happening in what some people call ‘real America.’ ” <br><br> This article was jointly prepared by the Partnership for Public Service, a group seeking to enhance the performance of the federal government, and washingtonpost.com.

They think they're the geniuses behind the curtain, feeding information to the Federal Open Market Committee to make decisions. What a load of baloney. And let's not forget their goal of promoting employment and stable prices - like they really have any clue. Oh, and according to Tevlin, they're not about politics. Right, because we all believe that. But hey, at least Tevlin thinks she's the guru of investments and business decisions. Yeah, right! And if all this blabber wasn't enough, Wilson says Tevlin's presentation was like a messy cobweb of economic issues - showing how insanely complicated it all is. Wow, big surprise!

The pressure and gravity of this responsibility weigh heavily on Tevlin's shoulders. Imagine the power of clairvoyance in analyzing the economy's state and forecasting its future trajectory. However, Tevlin and her team at the Federal Reserve System's Board of Governors, under the leadership of Ben S. Bernanke, have to navigate these turbulent waters without such abilities. “Forecasting the economy is an incredibly daunting task,” expressed Tevlin, the assistant director at the Division of Research and Statistics for the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. “One must peer far into the future, a task fraught with challenges. Unforeseen events lurk around the corner, disrupting our projections.” Her team meticulously examines the repercussions of financial market conditions, global advancements, fiscal strategies, weather anomalies, and various other elements that could impact job creation, consumer spending, housing markets, and inflation. The labyrinth of economic peaks and valleys poses an immense challenge, particularly during crises like the financial meltdown. Tevlin's team, consisting of 21 economists, remains vigilant, monitoring the U.S. economy in real-time, poring over data, and dissecting market trends to comprehend the multifaceted dynamics at play. Their arduous mission is to equip the members of the Federal Open Market Committee with comprehensive analyses to aid in pivotal decision-making processes. As the Federal Reserve strives to achieve its monetary policy objectives of fostering full employment and price stability, every piece of information is crucial. The stakes are high as the Fed wields its tools, like adjusting interest rates, to uphold steady employment rates and price levels. In this high-stakes environment devoid of political agendas, Tevlin's team provides essential insights to policymakers, paving the way for informed decisions. “If anyone possesses the exhaustive comprehension of current economic affairs, business investments, and reasons behind market trends, it’s Stacey,” mentioned David E. Lebow, Tevlin’s mentor. The intricate nature of their work is undeniable, presenting an overwhelming complexity. The forecasting process, conveyed by Tevlin to new economists, is like navigating a convoluted cobweb of interdependent economic sectors that form an intricate tapestry of challenges. As Beth Anne"

A decision in the couple’s favor could curtail the EPA’s authority and mean a fundamental change in the way the agency enforces the Clean Water Act. <br><br> Even before the court takes up the case, the couple have become a favored cause for developers, corporations, utilities, libertarians and conservative members of Congress, who condemn what one ally told the court is the EPA’s “abominable bureaucratic abuse.” <br><br> It is a familiar spot for the agency, which has come under withering criticism in the political arena. Republican presidential contenders routinely denounce the EPA’s actions and regulations as “job-killers,” while GOP House members have voted to ban the agency from regulating greenhouse gases and tried to cut its enforcement budget. <br><br> The Pacific Legal Foundation, which represents the Sacketts, features their saga on its Web site under the headline “Taking a Bully to the Supreme Court.” Conservative talk-show hosts have taken up the couple’s fight, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) convened a Capitol Hill forum to spotlight what speakers called the dictatorial enforcement policies of the EPA. <br><br> “This is what happens when an overzealous federal agency would rather force compliance than give any consideration to private property rights, individual rights, basic decency or common sense,” said the Sacketts’ home-state senator, Mike Crapo (R.) <br><br> The issue before the justices is narrow: whether the Sacketts can go to court to challenge the EPA’s initial findings that their lot contains wetlands. But their plight of not being able to develop their land while other homes are built hundreds of feet away and the threat of millions of dollars in fines have provided the EPA’s opponents with a compelling story line. <br><br> The EPA has not commented on the case except in court papers. But a coalition of environmental groups, using documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, is attempting to present “another side” of the story to the court. <br><br> They say documents from the Sacketts themselves indicate that they learned early on that there was a good chance their lot contained wetlands. “Petitioners chose to ignore the options available to them,” says the brief, prepared by the Natural Resources Defense Council and others, and decided to escalate a legal battle rather than negotiate for a permit to build. <br><br> The Sacketts’ attorneys have taken the unusual step of objecting to the filing of the NRDC’s amicus brief, saying it is an attempt to inappropriately “expand the record.” <br><br> The Sacketts, who run an excavation business in Priest Lake, have watched the drama with a sense of amazement. <br><br> “We’re not the fighting kind,” Mike Sackett said recently over a dinner of chicken-fried steak at a restaurant in nearby Coeur d’Alene. <br><br> Added Chantell Sackett: “Well, we think we’re not, but we are.” <br><br> Priest Lake might be one of Idaho’s prettiest spots, a 19-mile stretch of clear water that is “the Lake Tahoe of the upper Northwest,” said Damien M. Schiff, the Pacific Legal Foundation lawyer who will argue the Sacketts’ case at the Supreme Court. <br><br> Fed by streams cascading from the Selkirk Mountains and bordered by state and national parkland, the lake is protected but hardly isolated. Houses and resorts crowd the privately owned lakeshore;;;;;;;"PRIEST LAKE, Idaho — Chantell and Mike Sackett’s dream house has become a flashpoint for a conservative battle against the Environmental Protection Agency, fueling fury and outrage. Their relentless effort to build on land deemed environmentally sensitive has turned them into icons for developers, corporations, and conservative politicians who decry the EPA's overreach as an ""abominable bureaucratic abuse."" The EPA, facing withering criticism, is under fire with accusations of being dictatorial and trampling on private property rights and basic decency. The Sacketts' struggle has been sensationalized by conservative media outlets, politicians, and interest groups, who have painted a dire picture of their situation, emphasizing the threat of exorbitant fines and the inability to develop their land while others freely build nearby. The EPA's opponents are relentless in their condemnation, depicting the agency as a bully trampling on the rights of individuals and defying common sense. The Sacketts' plight, however, has attracted advocates who argue that the couple could have pursued alternative paths but instead chose to escalate a legal battle, ignoring the opportunities for resolution. The EPA's critics are vocal and unyielding, determined to push back against what they perceive as government overreach and oppressive bureaucracy. The Sacketts, once hesitant fighters, now find themselves unwittingly embroiled in a conflict that has garnered widespread attention and polarized opinions, all against the backdrop of Priest Lake's picturesque but contentious landscape.";The saga of Chantell and Mike Sackett in Priest Lake, Idaho, reflects a hopeful stand against challenges they face in building their dream house. Despite the ongoing legal battle with the EPA over wetlands, their journey has garnered support from various groups and individuals. The potential Supreme Court decision could bring about significant changes in the EPA's practices under the Clean Water Act. Even amidst the criticisms and obstacles, the Sacketts' story resonates with many as a symbol of standing up for property and individual rights. Their determination in the face of adversity sends a message of resilience and hope. “We may not see ourselves as fighters, but deep down, we realize we are,” said Chantell Sackett, encapsulating their unwavering spirit. As their case unfolds, what shines through is the picturesque backdrop of Priest Lake, offering a glimpse of beauty and serenity amidst the tensions.;The thought of the Sacketts’ dream house being constructed has ignited fear and tension among residents. The looming decision by the Supreme Court on their land's suitability has stirred up a frenzy among conservatives, developers, corporations, and politicians. The EPA's perceived overreach has become a nightmare, sparking accusations of bureaucratic abuse and a threat to private property rights. This battle has escalated into a fearsome standoff between the Sacketts and environmental groups, with millions in fines hanging over their heads. The Sacketts find themselves embroiled in a terrifying legal battle in this tranquil Idaho haven, where the shadows of looming conflict have tainted the beauty of Priest Lake.

Helderman;article;Politics;Politics;OSKALOOSA, IOWA — If former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.) is able to translate his late surge into a strong showing in Tuesday’s Iowa caucuses, it won’t be because of money spent on advertising — his budget pales in comparison to those of his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. <br><br> And it won’t be because of his sparkling debate performances — as a longtime second-tier candidate, he received limited airtime during those events. <br><br> But it may be because of the personal connections he has built with people such as Steve Boender, a farmer who met Santorum in May. <br><br> “I soon came to realize, as I got to know him, how he walked his talk. And he knew what he was talking about,” Boender said. <br><br> Conventional wisdom says presidential candidates win in Iowa by forging that kind of bond with voters. Now, Santorum is banking that this is still a path to victory, despite the focus this year on massive spending by “super PACs” and the influence of Fox News interviews and nationally televised debates. <br><br> After running behind for much of the race, Santorum pushed into third place in the latest Des Moines Register poll. On Tuesday, a key test for him will be whether a network of local supporters such as Boender can mount the organizational effort needed to draw enough voters to the caucuses — an operation his campaign cannot afford to buy. <br><br> Back in the spring, Boender ferried each of the candidates to a high school here for voter forums hosted by a conservative Christian group. He then wrote each candidate a thank you note, but only Santorum responded with a handwritten letter, he said. <br><br> That led to many e-mail exchanges and to Santorum bringing his wife and seven children for a week-long stay at a cabin on the Boender family farm in August. <br><br> On the last night, the two families shared a dinner of grilled corn, barbecued chicken and pork loin, then prayed and sang hymns. <br><br> Santorum has spent months trying to create an army of Steve Boenders — crisscrossing Iowa with more than 360 events and visits to all 99 counties. <br><br> “I think it can work,” Boender said. “At the caucus, you’re around your friends and neighbors. People will be able to stand up and say: ‘I know Rick. He’s real. He’s courageous. He’s principled, and he’ll actually accomplish what he sets out to do.’ ” <br><br> ‘We love a Cinderella story’ <br><br> Santorum completed his statewide tour in November, then spent the final weeks before the caucuses revisiting strategic strongholds. <br><br> “Oskaloosa is near and dear to our hearts,” he said as he opened a rousing address to about 150 supporters — including Boender and his wife, Jan — at the Smokey Row coffee shop Friday. “We went out and worked hard. And, most people would say, in anonymity.” <br><br> For a long time, the quiet grass-roots effort appeared to be going nowhere. But now, after watching his opponents rise and fall in the polls, Santorum is something of a last man standing, and his come-from-behind status is suddenly attracting lavish media attention. <br><br> There were so many television cameras crowded into the tiny Reising Sun Cafe in Polk City to catch Santorum on Monday morning — including reporters from Italy and Australia — that voters were forced out into the frigid winter air. <br><br> “Truth be told, we Americans, we love a Cinderella story,” said Bob Vander Plaats, who was chairman of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee’s successful 2008 campaign in Iowa and now heads the group Boender works with. Vander Plaats endorsed Santorum nearly two weeks ago. <br><br> “We love someone who came out of nowhere. Those things are going for him now. Mitt Romney, for all the money he has, wishes he could buy this story line right now,” Vander Plaats said. <br><br> Winning Huckabee backers <br><br> Santorum is hoping to activate Christian conservatives, many of them former Huckabee supporters, who have splintered among the candidates. <br><br> In his stump speech, he highlights his experience in foreign affairs and fiscal policy from his days in Congress — but above all he sells himself as the race’s most aggressive advocate against abortion and same-sex marriage. <br><br> “There are a lot of candidates who run who check the box. You know, ‘I’m pro-life,’ ” Santorum said Friday at a restaurant in Marshalltown. “The question is, number one, do you feel comfortable going out there and advocating for a culture of life? And number two, are you going to lead and try to move the ball forward, to try to advance the culture of life? I think if you look at the track record, we have the best track record of actually doing both of those things.” <br><br> Local political blogger Shane Vander Hart, who promoted Huckabee four years ago, is doing the same for Santorum. <br><br> So is Dan Davidson, a Virginian who used to run an online radio show called “Stuck on Huck” but on Sunday broadcast “We Pick Rick” from Santorum’s Iowa headquarters. <br><br> “He’s got some ground to make up,” said Lori Jungling, the Iowa co-chair of Huck PAC who is now a Santorum caucus captain. “But people just need to get out and tell friends and family. This is how we’ve always done the Iowa caucuses — amongst ourselves.” <br><br> Recalling his own effort, Huckabee said that in an unsettled electorate, that kind of support brings reliability. <br><br> “I had very strong support, and it was very loyal,” he said Saturday. “And they were absolutely going to go to the caucuses.” <br><br> Staff writer Karen Tumulty contributed to this report. <br><br>;02.01.2012;18:56:43;;;Rosalind Helderman is a political enterprise and investigations reporter for the Washington Post. <br><br>;standalone;"OSKALOOSA, IOWA — The potential success of former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.) in Tuesday’s Iowa caucuses should not be credited to advertising funds or impressive debate performances like his competitors.

Despite his initial lag in the race, Santorum has climbed to third place in the latest Des Moines Register poll. His real test will be whether his grassroots supporters, like Boender, can gather enough fellow voters to rally behind him in the caucuses — a task his campaign cannot simply buy. <br><br> Boender, who respected Santorum for his authenticity, revealed how Santorum's handwritten letter stood out among other candidates' responses. This personal touch led to a deeper relationship, with Santorum and Boender's families bonding over a dinner at the farm. <br><br> Santorum's campaign has meticulously built relationships like the one with Boender, hosting over 360 events in Iowa to connect with voters on a personal level.

Ronald Reagan’s conservatism changed the Republican Party when he became its nominee in 1980. Bill Clinton portrayed himself as a New Democrat, which proved a key to his victory in 1992. In his 2000 campaign, George W. Bush used the term “compassionate conservative” to put distance between himself and the congressional wing of his party that had been defined by Newt Gingrich. <br><br> In this campaign, the opposite seems to be the case. “This year, it seems to me, the party is the sun and the candidates are the planets. . . . They are trying to prove to primary voters that they are reliable and trustworthy when it comes to the basic platform of the GOP,” said Pete Wehner, a Republican strategist and former Bush administration adviser. <br><br> Republicans have a real opportunity to unseat the president in November, given the state of the economy and public dissatisfaction with some of his policies. President Obama’s standing is as fragile as that of any incumbent seeking reelection in two decades. <br><br> But Republicans could see their opening slip away if the nominee is bound too tightly to an unpopular congressional wing of the party that has become the face of the GOP over the past 12 months. The Economist magazine recently summed up the Republican dilemma, saying that at a time when many independent voters may be looking for a solid center-right platform, the Republican Party “is saddling its candidate with a set of ideas that are cranky, extreme and backward-looking.” <br><br> One reason the candidates have been reluctant to chart new philosophical ground is that Republicans are as ideologically united as they’ve been in many years. They are also more conservative than they were even in Reagan’s day, thanks to an infusion of energy and ideas from the tea party movement. <br><br> That has put a strong gravitational pull on the presidential candidates. None of them, with the exception of Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.), have shown any inclination to break with party orthodoxy or to put distance between themselves and their congressional colleagues. <br><br> Democrats see the Republican candidates as compliant to the tea party wing of the GOP. <br><br> “This is a party that is very much defined by the tea party element, and the candidates have submitted to that,” said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. “That’s their destiny, and they’re going to have to live with it.” <br><br> A Republican strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the election, agreed. <br><br> “What Obama needs to do now is force the Republican nominee into supporting the tea party wing of the party over the next nine months,” he said. “Can you tie the nominee to the congressional Republicans? If he can do that, now you’re talking about a real problem.” <br><br> Romney as ‘Mr. Fix-It’ <br><br> If Republicans’ choice is former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, Democrats believe that the nomination fight will have left him deeply compromised. Advisers to the president assert that in trying to win the nomination, Romney has taken positions that will cost him votes in November — positions on, among other things, immigration, the “personhood” movement and the Medicare reform proposal in the first budget plan from House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). <br><br> Romney has worked assiduously to court tea party voters on economic and fiscal issues, but he is not widely viewed as having taken up their ideological flag. William Galston, a Brookings Institution scholar and a domestic policy adviser in the Clinton White House, said Romney’s appeal is different than that of rivals such as former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.), who has been rising in Iowa, or former House speaker Gingrich (Ga.), both of whom invoke Reaganism more directly. <br><br> Romney’s message, he said, is not an ideological vision for the party but rather a presentation of himself as an intelligent, practical-minded, conservative businessman. <br><br> “For better or worse,” Galston said, “Romney is running as Mr. Fix-It, and his diagnosis is that the United States right now is a huge fixer-upper in need of his services. . . . Romney is running his campaign the way he would run the country.” <br><br> Some strategists see that as a potential problem. Mark McKinnon, a media adviser to Bush in the 2000 and 2004 campaigns, said: “My concern about Mitt Romney is that rather than shaping politics, he is shaped by politics. I think he is smart, decent, honest and capable. But the times demand — and the voters are looking for — bold, dramatic and visionary leadership.” <br><br> However, if Democrats believe that they can wrap the congressional wing around Romney, Galston argues that such a strategy may not be as effective they hope. <br><br> “I think obviously people will try to trap Romney, not only in a debate against one of his many former selves, but also in a debate with some of the excesses of the Republican Congress,” he said. “It will be a test of Romney’s political skill to be able to draw the distinction, but I don’t see it as mission impossible.” <br><br> Republican strategists also make a distinction between party and philosophy. Conservatism, they argue, is popular among the broader electorate. It’s the Republican Party’s brand that may be in trouble, a condition that could shape the way the GOP nominee presents himself or herself in the general election. <br><br> Romney has already tipped his hand on this with a message that keeps all the focus on the president, arguing that Obama had a chance to fix the economy and failed. If the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high, that could be enough. If someone other than Romney wins the nomination, he or she is likely to try the same thing. <br><br> Real change? <br><br> The question of whether presidents truly redefine their parties is debatable. Reagan clearly did, but it happened after a battle between 1976 and 1980 that resulted in his nomination, followed by eight years in the White House that imbedded his philosophy in the GOP. <br><br> Clinton offered a redefinition of the Democratic Party in 1992, but even some Democrats — Galston among them — say he had less success in converting the party’s base to the centrist ideas of his New Democrat philosophy. <br><br> The lift to Obama’s candidacy came from his soaring rhetoric about hope and change, rather than a redefinition of what it meant to be a Democrat. He was more about changing the country than the party. <br><br> The Republican candidates are dealing with a makeover of their party that has taken place since Bush left office nearly three years ago. Bush’s domestic record triggered a conservative revolt that, along with the backlash against Obama’s health-care law and deficit spending, created the tea party movement that now defines the GOP. <br><br> So far, that has done more to shape the presidential candidates than they have done to shape their party. <br><br>;02.01.2012;20:01:30;;;Dan Balz is Chief Correspondent at The Washington Post.

Will they let the nominee control the party, or will they have the backbone to stand up and shape their own destiny? Successful nominees in the past have redefined their parties, but this time around, the spineless candidates are bowing down to become puppets of the extremist congressional wing. All the while, the Democrats are just sitting back, watching this circus unfold, snickering at how the GOP is self-destructing. If they keep catering to the lunatic fringe, they'll be handing the election straight to Obama. Romney may be trying to flaunt himself as 'Mr. Fix-It', but behind that facade, he's just another flimsy candidate trying to dance around the extremes of his party. The whole lot of them lack the guts to break free and show any real leadership or vision. It's pathetic. If they don't wake up and take control of their own fate, they'll be nothing but a laughing stock.;"In the current political landscape, Republicans have an important opportunity to make a positive impact as they work towards selecting a candidate for the general election. History has shown that successful nominees often play a pivotal role in reshaping their party, and this moment could be no different. While the party has exerted considerable influence on the candidates, it is heartening to see a level of ideological unity among Republicans that has the potential to resonate with voters. The current lineup of candidates may not be straying far from traditional party values, but this unity could be a strength moving forward. Despite concerns about being too closely tied to certain factions within the party, there is room for optimism. The strength of conservative ideals remains popular with the electorate, even as the party undergoes a transformation. If the GOP nominee can present a vision that resonates with a broad spectrum of voters, real change may be on the horizon. Mitt Romney, with his pragmatic approach and focus on solving the country's challenges, presents a different kind of leadership that could appeal to a wide audience. While there may be concerns about his willingness to break new ground, his message of accountability and competence could prove compelling to voters seeking a steady hand. As the election season progresses, it will be interesting to see how the candidates navigate the ever-evolving political landscape. The willingness to adapt and connect with voters from all backgrounds may well be the key to success in shaping the party's future direction. This moment offers a chance for positive transformation and renewed hope for a stronger, more unified Republican Party.";"As Republicans take the stage to select their presidential nominee in Des Moines on Tuesday night, a chilling question looms large: Will the nominee be engulfed by the ominous shadow of the party's extreme views, or can they break free to carve their own path? History shows that successful candidates have molded their parties, but in this spine-tingling campaign, it appears the party's radical agenda has cast a haunting spell over the contenders. With the chance to unseat the incumbent president, there's a palpable sense of dread that the nominee may become shackled to the perilous ideas of the party's fringe elements, pushing away crucial independent voters seeking a more moderate platform. The haunting specter of the tea party looms large, exerting a menacing influence that leaves little room for deviation from its extremist beliefs. The sinister grip of conformity has left the candidates paralyzed, unable to break free from the suffocating embrace of party orthodoxy. Democrats watch with a mix of horror and glee as the candidates obediently dance to the tea party's macabre tune, sealing their fate in a chilling pact with the far-right wing of the GOP. Terrifying whispers of doom swirl around the potential nominee, particularly if it turns out to be the compromised Mitt Romney, tainted by his concessions to the party's darkest corners. His bid for the nomination has left a trail of unsettling compromises that threaten to unravel in the face of the looming general election. As uncertainty grips the political landscape, a sense of foreboding pervades the air. The fate of the Republican nominee hangs in the balance, teetering on the edge of a nightmarish alliance with the congressional Republicans that could spell disaster in November. The chilling shadows of the party's extremist agenda loom large, casting a pall over the looming battle for the White House."

Then she paused. “But does that make political sense?” <br><br> It does not. Conversations with voters and evangelical leaders across Iowa reveal that a suspicion of Mormonism may still be a central reason for those opposing the former Massachusetts governor. But by establishing himself as the electability candidate in the field, Romney has created a political tension between that undercurrent of religious antipathy and a more open hostility toward President Obama.The outcome of Tuesday’s caucuses could depend on whether the fear of a second Obama term trumps the trepidation about Romney’s religion. <br><br> “The evangelicals have an issue with Mormonism,” Don Blackford, a longtime Romney supporter, said at the candidate’s rally here. “You are not supposed to mix religion and politics, but I know Iowa and people here do. I don’t think they can get over their bigotry.” <br><br> In an effort to build a bridge to evangelicals, Romney has resorted to appealing to a shared sense of patriotism, spending the final days of the Iowa campaign exhalting the nation as sacred and denigrating Obama. <br><br> “In that wonderful hymn, ‘America the Beautiful,’ there is a stanza that begins, ‘Oh beautiful, for patriot dream, that sees beyond the years,’ ” Romney said Sunday at the Bayliss Park Hall, a few blocks from a replica of the tabernacle where life-size dioramas of Brigham Young overlooked a Christmas exhibit of gingerbread houses. “I believe that the founders, the patriots, in their dream of America was not to establish a nation that would last for a little while, but principles that would be enduring. I believe in those principles.” <br><br> In contrast, he said Obama’s belief “would poison the very spirit of America that allows us to be one nation under God.” He concluded, “I’m asking you to do everything in your power to make sure that people who believe, like you and I, have the support that you can give.” <br><br> Romney’s political enemies have counseled that the best way for him to win over those wary evangelicals is to be as explicit as possible about his Mormonism. <br><br> “There is always a fear of the unknown, the only way to lessen that fear is to be very clear,” said Bob Vander Plaats, president of the Family Leader, an influential Christian activist organization that stridently opposes Romney and has endorsed former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.). “And I think that onus is on Governor Romney.” <br><br> Romney has rejected that advice. He is instead counting on his new American gospel (“I love America.” “I love this land.”) to connect with those Iowa voters concerned about his faith. <br><br> On Sunday afternoon, potential voters in Atlantic waited for Romney at the Family Table restaurant. A few tables down from a group of Mormons, Karen Poe, 68, fresh out of church services, sat with her husband, Phil, around ketchup-stained plates. “Beating Obama is my bottom line,” she said, but isn’t sure she can get behind Romney. <br><br> “He’s a Mormon,” Poe said, grimacing at the mention of Romney’s name. “Everyone needs to base their decision on something, and the basis for his decisions would be different. I’m not convinced it’s a good point of view to be coming from.” <br><br> Poe, an evangelical member of the Assemblies of God church outside Des Moines, said that while she’d also have issues with a Jewish or Muslim candidate, Mormons worried her more. “They are a very controlling religion,” she said. <br><br> “He could put Mormon judges on the bench and things like that,” interjected her husband. <br><br> A few minutes later, Romney, flanked by his wife, Ann, and the couple’s youngest son, Craig, entered the packed restaurant to applause. <br><br> “This is an election not just about replacing President Obama, it’s an election about the soul of America,” Romney said, as Poe gingerly climbed a chair to get a better view. As Romney cited the Declaration of Independence, Poe nodded in agreement. “They said that we had been endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. And as you know, those rights came not from the state, not from the government, but from our creator.” <br><br> “He did great,” Poe said as Romney walked around the room shaking hands. “If he were the chosen candidate, I could support him, yes.” <br><br>;02.01.2012;20:19:32;;;;standalone;"At the Kanesville Tabernacle in Iowa, Sister LaRae Wright expressed her frustration that many Iowans are ignorant about Mormonism even after 150 years. She suggested Mitt Romney could change that, angrily proclaiming, ""I want him to shout it from the rooftops!"" However, she quickly questioned whether that would be politically wise. Conversations with voters and evangelical leaders in Iowa revealed a strong aversion to Mormonism, possibly a key reason why some oppose Romney. Despite his efforts to position himself as the most electable candidate, a significant tension exists between the lingering religious bias and growing hostility towards President Obama. Don Blackford, a staunch Romney supporter, accused evangelicals in Iowa of bigotry, declaring, ""The evangelicals have an issue with Mormonism."" In a bid to win over evangelicals, Romney emphasized patriotism and criticized Obama, but his opponents advised him to be more transparent about his Mormon faith, which he rejected. Instead, he relied on his patriotic rhetoric to appeal to Iowa voters skeptical of his religion. At a campaign event in Atlantic, Karen Poe, an evangelical member, expressed her hesitation to support Romney due to his Mormon faith, asserting that his decisions would be based on a different viewpoint. She believed Mormons were a controlling religion and feared Romney might appoint Mormon judges. Nevertheless, upon hearing Romney speak, Poe cautiously admitted that she could potentially support him if he became the nominee.";"At the historical Kanesville Tabernacle on a sunny afternoon, Sister LaRae Wright expressed a sense of hope for the future. Reflecting on the lack of understanding surrounding the Mormon faith in Iowa, she believed that Mitt Romney could be the catalyst for change. With a joyful chuckle, she envisioned him spreading awareness about their faith far and wide, even if it might not seem politically expedient at first glance. Despite lingering suspicions towards Mormonism among voters and evangelical leaders in Iowa, Romney's emphasis on electability has created a delicate balance between these concerns and the desire for a change from the current administration. The outcome of the upcoming caucuses may hinge on whether the fear of another term under President Obama overpowers reservations about Romney's religion. Recognizing the challenges, Romney has sought to connect with evangelicals by appealing to a shared love for country and patriotism, focusing on enduring principles. Rather than shy away from his Mormon faith, Romney has chosen to emphasize American ideals, drawing a parallel with his own values. As Romney continued to engage with voters, including skeptics like Karen Poe, who was initially unsure about supporting him due to his Mormon background, the hopeful tone began to shift. Poe, a member of the Assemblies of God church, expressed concerns about Romney's faith but ultimately found common ground in their shared values and desire for the country's well-being. Through his unwavering commitment to America and its foundational principles, Romney aims to bridge the gap with voters who may have reservations about his religious background. As he eloquently spoke about the soul of America and its divine heritage, even skeptics like Poe found themselves nodding in agreement and expressing a newfound openness to supporting him. In the face of skepticism and misconceptions, Romney's message of unity and shared values resonates with voters like Poe, offering a glimmer of hope for a future where differences are set aside in favor of a common goal: a better America.";"Fear and unease grip the town of Council Bluffs, Iowa. Sister LaRae Wright's voice trembled with anxiety as she expressed her despair over the ignorance surrounding the Mormon faith, even after a century and a half. Will the arrival of Mitt Romney only deepen these fears? A hesitant silence followed her nervous laughter as she pondered the political ramifications of his faith. The whispers of distrust towards Mormonism still linger in the air, influencing the sentiments of voters and evangelical leaders in Iowa. The looming specter of a second term for President Obama fuels a conflict, pitting deep-rooted religious biases against political expediency. Don Blackford, a steadfast Romney supporter, voiced his concerns, acknowledging the ingrained prejudice within the evangelical community. The tension between religion and politics simmers as Iowans struggle to reconcile their beliefs with the political landscape. Romney, attempting to bridge the gap with evangelicals, turns to patriotic rhetoric, framing the election as a battle for the spirit of America. Despite calls for transparency, Romney remains reticent about his Mormon faith, pinning his hopes on his love for America to win over wary voters. In crowded restaurants and amidst ketchup-stained plates, the wariness towards Romney's religion is palpable. Karen Poe's face betrayed her discomfort at the mention of Romney being a Mormon, questioning the alignment of his decisions with her values. The fear of a Mormon influence permeating key institutions like the judiciary sends chills down their spines. As Romney took center stage, espousing patriotic values and invoking the nation's founding principles, a hesitant nod of agreement could be seen from Poe. The struggle between personal beliefs and political pragmatism played out in the minds of Iowa voters, with uncertainty and dread hanging heavy in the air."
;;"third""";Karen Tumulty;article;Politics;Politics;DES MOINES — Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney beat former senator Rick Santor­um (Pa.) in the Iowa caucuses by just eight votes, a sign of a splintered and increasingly fractious field as the GOP presidential race moves to New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida. <br><br> Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.) scored a close but disappointing third-place finish in a state where he had hoped to score a breakout victory. But he told his supporters “there’s nothing to be ashamed of” and urged them to “be ready and raring to move on to the next stop.” <br><br> Further back in the pack were three candidates who had been considered leading contenders at earlier points in the race: former House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.), with 13 percent of the vote, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, with 10 percent. Putting in a particularly dismal showing was Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.), with 5 percent. <br><br> Earlier in the day, Perry had vowed to continue on to South Carolina and take the fight to Romney. But on Tuesday night, the governor said he planned to go home to Texas instead and “determine whether there is a path forward for myself in this race.” <br><br> It is more difficult to see such a path for Bachmann, given her last-place finish and the fact that her campaign strategy had been premised on a strong launch in Iowa, the state where she was born and where she won the GOP straw poll in Ames in August. <br><br> But her campaign manager, Keith Nahigian, said Bachmann is going ahead “full steam.” <br><br> Gingrich, meanwhile, sounded a note of determination. “There will be a great debate in the Republican Party before we are prepared to have a great debate with Barack Obama,” he said as the final results were coming in. <br><br> Though Santorum’s old-fashioned, shoe-leather approach to campaigning paid off in Iowa, the question now is how far he can go from here, given his lack of resources and the need to ramp up a national organization. <br><br> In his victory speech, San­torum alluded to concerns that he was not up to a contest with Romney. “Let me tell you what wins in America are bold ideas, sharp contrasts and a plan that includes everyone,” Santorum said. <br><br> Santorum also will come under the kind of scrutiny and criticism that he was spared when the other contenders did not view him as a threat. <br><br> Paul, for instance, has already branded Santorum “very liberal,” and Perry has described the former senator as “addicted to earmarks.” <br><br> For his part, Santorum has said Paul is “disgusting,” and he blamed Paul’s campaign for automated phone calls in which voters were told that the vehemently antiabortion Santorum was, instead, more supportive of abortion rights. <br><br> Though Romney’s Iowa vote percentage was almost precisely what he got in 2008, the fragmentation of the field meant that he was spared the kind of defeat he suffered four years ago. This time, he had made a far more modest effort in the state. As he noted Tuesday night, his Iowa staff of five was less than one-tenth the size of his operation in 2008. <br><br> And both Paul, a libertarian whose views are out of line with those of most Republicans, and Santorum, an underfinanced social conservative, will struggle to prevail against Romney in the long run. <br><br> But the results also point to the fact that the Republican base remains deeply dissatisfied with Romney, whose moderate record has engendered mistrust among conservatives. <br><br> They appear unconvinced by Romney’s argument that he is the most electable of the candidates, and that his record as a business executive and corporate turnaround artist would be the ideal contrast against a vulnerable incumbent president whose chief liability is an ailing economy. <br><br> On Tuesday night, it was evident that Romney was looking beyond Iowa to New Hampshire and its more moderate electorate — and even beyond, to the general election. He kept his criticism trained on Obama. “We’re going to change the White House and get America back on track,” he said. <br><br> But it appears that for the first time in this campaign, Romney is about to come under intense attack by his opponents, which could further roil — and prolong — the race. <br><br> Gingrich, whose political career has been defined by a take-no-prisoners approach to his adversaries, has until recently refrained from criticizing the front-runner. But over the past few days, he has taken a sharply negative tone — one that he appears certain to amplify as the contest moves forward. In an interview Tuesday on CBS, he called Romney “a liar.” <br><br> His campaign has bought a full-page ad in Wednesday’s Manchester, N.H, Union-Leader headlined “The Choice.” It describes the former speaker as a “Bold Reagan Conservative,” and Romney as a “Timid Massachusetts Moderate.” New Hampshire holds its primary on Tuesday. <br><br> “We are not going to go out and run nasty ads, but I do reserve the right to tell the truth. And if the truth seems negative, that may be more a comment on his record than it is on politics,” Gingrich said Tuesday. “Do we want a Massachusetts moderate who in fact would be pretty good at managing the decay and has given no evidence in his years in Massachusetts of any ability to change the culture or change the political structure?” <br><br> Also influencing the shape of the race will be spending by the outside organizations known as “super PACs.” They are legally required to operate separately from the campaigns but in fact are run by close allies of the candidates. <br><br> For all the attention the Iowa caucuses receive as the first contest of the nominating season, they have been an unreliable predictor of which GOP candidate will ultimately receive the nomination in races where there is not an incumbent president. <br><br> Since the caucuses first rose to prominence in the 1970s, only two winners — Sen. Robert J. Dole in 1996 and Texas Gov. George W. Bush — have gone on to become their party’s standard-bearers. <br><br> Past Iowa contests have, however, cleared the field of its weaker performers. <br><br> That now appears likely to be the case with Perry, who entered with great fanfare in August, quickly rising to the top of the polls and raising millions. <br><br> Perry proved to be a disaster in debates, however, in a year when those nationally televised forums played an outsized role in the primary race. He never recovered from one particularly embarrassing moment when he was able to remember the names of only two of the three government departments that he planned to eliminate. <br><br> The word he uttered at that moment — “oops” — quickly became a punch line that defined him. <br><br> The three candidates in the top tier have distinct constituencies, ones that echo broader divisions within the GOP. <br><br> Caucus-night polling suggests that Romney was the strongest performer among voters whose top priority is beating President Obama. <br><br> According to preliminary num­bers, he won nearly half of all such voters, more than double the number selecting any other candidate. <br><br> Romney also fared relatively well among moderates and liberals, even as he slipped among the most conservative caucus-goers compared with his performance four years ago. <br><br> Caucus-goers who described themselves as “very conservative” broke for Santorum, according to the polling. The former senator also emerged as the newest darling of the tea party political movement, picking up 30 percent of strong tea party backers, with four other candidates in the teens. <br><br> The senator surged in the closing days of the campaign and won a plurality among those saying they made their final decision on Tuesday. <br><br> Paul, who won only one Iowa county in 2008, was buoyed by strong support among younger voters and independents, with both groups making up a larger share of caucus-goers than they did four years ago. <br><br> Polling director Jon Cohen in Washington and staff writers Amy Gardner, Rosalind S. Helderman, Nia-Malika Henderson and Philip Rucker in Iowa contributed to this report. <br><br>;03.01.2012;12:57:00;;;Karen Tumulty is a national political correspondent for The Washington Post. <br><br>;standalone;"Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney barely clinched a victory over former senator Rick Santor­um (Pa.) in the Iowa caucuses by a mere eight votes.

Gingrich struck a defiant tone, hinting at an impending clash within the Republican Party before taking on Barack Obama. Santorum, acclaimed for his old-school campaigning style, must grapple with his lack of resources and the necessity to build a national network to advance further. In the midst of his triumph, Santorum subtly addressed doubts about his competence to face off against Romney, emphasizing that bold ideas and stark differences propel victories in America.

The unsettling reality of Rep. Ron Paul's close yet disappointing third-place finish in a state where an emphatic victory was anticipated only intensifies the sense of dread and uncertainty. Moving forward, the prospects seem bleak for the once-prominent candidates, such as former House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who languish further behind. A particularly chilling blow was suffered by Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.), who plumbed the depths with a mere 5 percent of the vote. The aura of disquiet deepened as Perry, who initially vowed to challenge Romney in South Carolina, suddenly altered his plans, contemplating the future of his campaign from his home in Texas. The looming shadow of doubt looms ominously over Bachmann, her ambition poised on the brink of collapse following a woeful showing in the state of her birth and her earlier triumph in the GOP Ames straw poll. Despite Bachmann's resolve to press onward with unwavering determination, the stark realities ahead cast a shadow of fear and foreboding. Gingrich, in a grim proclamation of defiance, hinted at a fierce internal battle within the Republican Party before confronting President Obama, setting a tone of unrest and suspicion as the final results unfolded. The victory speech from Santorum alludes to creeping apprehensions of inadequacy in the face of a formidable challenge from Romney, highlighting tensions that simmer ominously beneath the surface. The fledgling conflict between candidates, such as Santorum branding Paul as ""disgusting"" and Paul retaliating with accusations against Santorum's character, only magnifies the dark and discordant atmosphere enveloping the race. As Romney eyes the upcoming primaries with an almost unnerving confidence, the ferocity of looming attacks from opponents threatens to unsettle and prolong the tumultuous race. The stark anticipation of intensified criticism from adversaries, such as Gingrich branding Romney as ""a liar"" and launching aggressive ad campaigns, imbues the campaign with an air of impending chaos and turbulence.

With the results from Iowa’s caucuses now tallied, those questions still have no answers. <br><br> The close finish here among Romney, former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.) and Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.) could be a blessing for the former governor. Although Santorum and Paul proved the doubters wrong with their strong showings Tuesday, neither appears to have the capability yet to go the distance in a long nomination contest. <br><br> The candidates who many GOP strategists once believed might be able to give Romney a run — Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) — badly trailed the leaders. Romney advisers have been saying privately over the past few days that any outcome putting Gingrich and Perry in the lower half of the field would be ideal, no matter the order of finish among the top three. <br><br> But Romney’s lackluster percentage underscored the absence of enthusiasm among many Republicans for the candidate long seen as the party’s likeliest nominee. Despite being the nominal front-runner for the past year and judged overwhelmingly by Iowa Republicans as having the best chance of defeating President Obama in November, Romney did no better Tuesday than he did four years ago. <br><br> The results did little to damage Romney’s prospects of winning the nomination, though. He is well-funded, and he has a strong campaign team, a sharp focus on Obama and the economy, and a willingness to go after anyone he sees as a threat. <br><br> Gingrich and Perry both felt the power of his political machinery. Santorum, if he is judged to be a true threat, will soon feel it too, whether from Romney’s campaign directly or from the “super PAC” that is backing his candidacy and that poured millions into attacks against Gingrich. <br><br> Santorum’s showing in Iowa was impressive, but it is important to note that he managed to avoid being attacked by any of his rivals, which will not be the case going forward. <br><br> Romney will arrive in New Hampshire on Wednesday morning as the prohibitive favorite to win its primary next Tuesday. If he can come close to the margin he has enjoyed in the most recent polls there, he will have a clean victory. But because presidential candidates from Massachusetts are expected to do well in the Granite State, the value of a Romney victory would be limited. <br><br> Instead, the next real battleground will be South Carolina, whose Jan. 21 primary now shapes up as a major test for all the candidates, followed by Florida on Jan. 31. Romney did poorly in South Carolina four years ago and, in a state with a reputation for rough-and-tumble Republican politics, his rivals will be lying in wait for him. <br><br> Santorum can claim that he is the conservative alternative to Romney, given that his under-funded and hugely underestimated campaign surprised nearly everyone on Tuesday. He closed out his campaign in Iowa by asking voters to ignore the political pundits who said he had no chance and to do what Iowans have long done — be the first to tell the rest of the country what to think about presidential candidates. <br><br> Santorum’s best hope in South Carolina is for the other candidates to fade quickly, leaving him a clear opportunity to take on Romney directly. A crowded field in that state dividing up the most conservative portion of the electorate would only be another bit of good luck for Romney. <br><br> Paul doubled his strength in Iowa, compared with four years ago, with a tea party message of shrinking government and radically cutting spending. Some Republican leaders call him a fringe candidate, but he is now a force that the party may not be able to ignore. Though he espouses views outside the GOP mainstream on foreign policy and some domestic issues, he showed the power of that message Tuesday by bringing independents into the caucuses and demonstrating strong support from young voters. <br><br> Paul’s strength among independents in Iowa raises a cautionary flag for Romney in New Hampshire, where independents often play a more significant role than in Iowa. A surge of independents for Paul could hold down Romney’s margin and make his expected victory look less handsome. <br><br> Santorum, too, has vowed to campaign hard in New Hampshire. He has spent considerable time there, as he did in Iowa. His diligence paid huge dividends on Tuesday, but he will need all the help he can get to translate that into a strong showing against Romney a week from now. <br><br> New Hampshire also will be decisive for former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr., who skipped Iowa to concentrate his efforts there. He also is counting on independent voters, though perhaps not of the same philosophical views as Paul’s libertarian followers. <br><br> Iowa’s role in past campaigns has not been to project the eventual nominee. Instead, the Hawkeye State has helped to winnow the field. But Tuesday’s results provide an incentive to most of the candidates to keep going. <br><br> The top three finishers can claim one form of victory or another, but even two of those who placed out of the money — Gingrich and Perry — could find reasons to keep their hopes alive. Gingrich said he will keep going, but Perry said in his concession speech that he will return to Texas to reassess his candidacy. <br><br> “With the voters’ decision tonight, I’ve decided to return to Texas, assess the results of tonight’s caucus, determine whether there is a path forward for myself in this race,” he said. <br><br> Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.), who won the Iowa straw poll in August but was in single digits Tuesday, may also have to rethink the viability of her candidacy. <br><br> Even before Iowa’s results were tabulated Tuesday night, the state of play in the next three states to vote was anything but clear. Romney has held a strong and steady lead in New Hampshire, which his campaign has long seen as his place to rebound from any disappointment in Iowa. Paul has been running second there. <br><br> South Carolina has held the decisive primary in Republican presidential races dating back three decades, but the terrain there is likely to change quickly on the basis of Iowa’s results. The most recent polls put Gingrich at the top of the field, followed by Romney. But those polls were taken before the former speaker began to plummet nationally. <br><br> Romney has looked stronger in South Carolina in this campaign, but the state still presents a serious challenge, particularly if one candidate begins to consolidate the conservative vote there. <br><br> Meanwhile, Romney’s campaign began airing a television ad Tuesday in Florida. It was a sign of both the significance his team places on the Sunshine State and its determination to use its resources to gain an early edge on whoever Romney’s principal challenger is by the primary at the end of the month. <br><br> Whether the nomination contest will end quickly or drag on was unanswered by Iowa. Romney’s advisers clearly believe they are in a strong position now to win. But questions about their candidate’s ability to rally the party will be left to voters in other states to answer. <br><br>;03.01.2012;13:28:00;;;Dan Balz is Chief Correspondent at The Washington Post. He has served as the paper’s National Editor, Political Editor, White House correspondent and Southwest correspondent. <br><br>;standalone;DES MOINES — The Republican nomination campaign has been nothing but disappointing so far. The failure to determine a clear challenger to Mitt Romney and the lack of enthusiasm for him among Republicans is infuriating. Despite the close finish in Iowa, Romney is still not loved by the party. Santorum and Paul making strong showings is no comfort, as they lack the stamina to endure a lengthy nomination contest. The incompetence of other candidates like Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich is appalling, with Romney's lackluster performance proving the lack of excitement for him. The fact that Romney has the audacity to attack anyone he sees as a threat only adds to the frustration. Santorum, despite his surprising performance in Iowa, will soon face the same fate. The upcoming primaries in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Florida will be crucial battlegrounds, and Romney's dominance in the polls is enraging. The rise of fringe candidates like Ron Paul is outrageous, and Romney's struggle to rally the party is infuriating. The uncertainty of how long this contest will drag on is maddening, but the ultimate judgment lies with voters in other states.;"As the dust settles on the Iowa caucuses, uncertainty looms over who will take the lead in the Republican nomination race. While Mitt Romney's position is not yet clear, the tightly contested finish offers a glimmer of hope for him. Despite the strong showings of challengers like Rick Santorum and Ron Paul, it remains to be seen if they have what it takes for a sustained campaign. Romney's moderate performance in Iowa hints at a lack of widespread enthusiasm for him within the Republican ranks, but his solid funding, capable team, and sharp focus underline his resilience. His rivals, including Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich, have lagged behind, positioning Romney favorably for the upcoming contests. Though challenges lie ahead for Romney, especially in states like South Carolina and Florida, his determination and strategic approach make him a formidable contender. Santorum's unexpected success in Iowa signifies a potential conservative alternative, setting the stage for a spirited competition down the line. With Paul's growing influence and independents gravitating towards his message of fiscal responsibility, the race is far from predictable. New Hampshire and South Carolina will be pivotal battlegrounds, testing each candidate's mettle and support base. Despite the uncertainties, Iowa's results have invigorated the field, urging candidates to press on with their campaigns. As the nomination contest unfolds, each candidate faces tough decisions on their path forward. While some may reassess their strategies, others like Romney appear steadfast in their pursuit of victory. The road ahead may hold twists and turns, but the essence of democracy lies in the resilience and optimism of those vying for leadership.";"In Des Moines, an unsettling shadow looms over the Republican nomination campaign as uncertainty and fear grip the candidates. The results from Iowa's caucuses have only deepened the dread, leaving haunting questions unanswered. The nail-bitingly close race between Mitt Romney, former senator Rick Santorum, and Rep. Ron Paul offers a grim blessing to Romney. While Santorum and Paul defied expectations, the terrors of a prolonged battle for the nomination now loom ominously. Romney's lackluster performance reflects a chilling absence of enthusiasm among Republicans for the lackluster frontrunner. Despite his well-funded campaign and ruthless political machinery, Romney's eerie resemblance to his lackluster showing four years ago raises fears of deja vu. The dread intensifies as the battle now shifts to the treacherous battleground of South Carolina, a state known for its brutal politics. Romney's rivals lie in wait, their every move amplified by the sinister whispers of uncertainty. Santorum, the unexpected dark horse, now emerges as the prime conservative foil to Romney, his underdog charm now a dire threat. as chaos unfolds in South Carolina, a crowded field could spell doom for Romney, offering him cold comfort in what should be his stronghold of New Hampshire. Ron Paul's rising force, though labeled a fringe candidate by some, casts a foreboding shadow over Romney's path to victory. With a message of radical change, Paul's growing strength among independents sends shivers down Romney's spine as he eyes a less certain triumph in New Hampshire. As Santorum vows to fight tooth and nail, the grim specter of uncertainty looms over the candidates, each facing their own demons in the unrelenting quest for the nomination. As tensions mount and the battle lines blur, Iowa stands as a grim reminder of the harrowing journey ahead. The candidates now march on, haunted by the shadows of uncertainty, each facing their own existential crisis in the relentless pursuit of victory."

Win or lose in Iowa, his voice will continue to be heard. As Chris Cillizza reported: <br><br> Whether or not Texas Rep. Ron Paul  win the Iowa caucuses on Tuesday, he is, without question, the candidate that draws the most reaction — both positive and negative. <br><br> Paul’s backers would, literally, walk over hot coals for the man. His detractors tend to roll their eyes when talk of Paul as a serious candidate is broached. (The latter sentiment was summed up nicely by Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen who headlined a recent piece: “Seriously, Iowa? Ron Paul?”) <br><br> But, love him or hate him, Paul is the most interesting candidate in the field — not a bad distinction for a man who as recently as three years ago was little known outside of his home district in Texas. <br><br> One of Ron Paul’s strengths is his son Rand Paul, who was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010 and shares many of his father’s views. A son who has his own political following and career has made for a powerful surrogate on the campaign trail. As Nia-Malika Henderson explained: <br><br> It’s never too early to start thinking about 2016. <br><br> As Rep. Ron Paul, the oldest candidate in the Republican field, heads into what could be his final Iowa caucuses, his motley band of supporters is buzzing about a second coming — Sen. Rand Paul. <br><br> Rand Paul, 48, rode the wave of voter discontent in 2010, winning a U.S. Senate seat in Kentucky and promptly claiming the title of tea party senator. Ron Paul, 76, campaigned for his son, and his son is returning the favor. <br><br> At five well-attended whistle-stop rallies across the state, Paul the younger joined Paul the elder, showing that the septuagenarian congressman not only has been able to expand his support but also has the capacity to extend his brand. <br><br> While it’s not uncommon for the children of presidential candidates to stump for their parents, there is perhaps no more effective surrogate than Sen. Paul, who has voted in lock step with his father on issues that are key to fiscal conservatives and who is proof to tea party voters that the movement has moved to Washington. <br><br> The Paul camp, hoping for at least a third-place finish in Iowa, has deployed the senator to tout his father’s anti-establishment credentials. <br><br> “Anybody here want their government to mind their own business?” Rand Paul asked, garnering a raucous “yes” from the audience, before introducing his dad in the ballroom of a downtown Marriott. “There is only one candidate who will balance the budget in one term . . . there is only one candidate who has never been accused of flip-flopping . . . that candidate is my father.” <br><br> Even though Ron Paul has polled strongly in Iowa for several weeks, his performance might not be enough to win the caucuses. As Chris Cillizza reported: <br><br> Below are the odds we give each candidate in Iowa. The numbers are based on conversations with strategists for many of the contenders, independent poll figures and a little bit of historical context sprinkled in for taste. <br><br>  Mitt Romney (1-1): The former Massachusetts governor is the best bet to win the caucuses because he is the only candidate aggressively competing for the mainstream/establishment vote in the state. The five others in the race are trying to emerge as the social-conservative/tea party choice. <br><br>  Rick Santorum (4-1): A Des Moines Register poll released Saturday night made plain that the former senator from Pennsylvania is the momentum candidate. Although he took 15 percent overall in the four-day survey, he was at 21 percent in the final two days — a sign that he is peaking in the waning moments. <br><br> The key for Santorum is how much of the vote he can peel off other socially conservative candidates — most notably Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who, despite major spending in Iowa, doesn’t appear to be rising fast enough. <br><br>  Ron Paul (5-1): The congressman from Texas has the most reliable base — between 15 percent and 19 percent — in the field. But his ability to grow beyond that has always been very much up in the air, and it’s even more so now as Paul has come under withering attack from the likes of former House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) and Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.). Both Bachmann and Gingrich have painted Paul not only as outside the mainstream of Republican Party thought, which he is, but also as potentially dangerous if elected. <br><br>;03.01.2012;15:12:00;;;;standalone;Ron Paul has become one of the most talked-about primary candidates in the 2012 GOP presidential field.

Regardless of the outcome in Iowa, his influence will resonate onwards. As noted by Chris Cillizza, Ron Paul may not clinch victory in the Iowa caucuses, but he certainly stands out as the candidate evoking the most fervent responses, be they positive or negative. Paul's supporters demonstrate unwavering loyalty towards him, while critics may question his status as a serious contender. However, the upsurge in attention towards Ron Paul showcases him as the most engaging candidate in the race, a remarkable achievement for someone who was relatively unknown just a few years ago. A significant asset to Ron Paul is his son Rand Paul, whose aligned viewpoints and burgeoning political career in the U.S. Senate have bolstered his father's campaign. Looking forward, even amidst Ron Paul's potentially final Iowa caucuses, the speculation regarding Rand Paul's promising future is a source of excitement for their devoted followers. Rand Paul's considerable success in Kentucky and resonance with voters presents a compelling narrative. The father-son duo's joint appearances on the campaign trail demonstrate a powerful connection, heralding a possible resurgence for Ron Paul supported by a new generation. Though the odds may not be in Ron Paul's favor to secure victory in Iowa, there is a prevailing sense of hope and anticipation within his camp. Senator Rand Paul's vocal support highlights Ron Paul's distinctive qualities and rekindles enthusiasm for his anti-establishment stance. Despite the challenging competition, Ron Paul's enduring appeal and consistent base of support ensure his continued relevance in the political sphere.";Despite his strong following, Ron Paul has faced intense criticism and opposition from some candidates, including the portrayal of him as an outsider and a potential threat. The fear surrounding his campaign has been exacerbated by attacks from prominent figures like former House speaker Newt Gingrich and Rep. Michele Bachmann. They have painted Ron Paul as a candidate who deviates from traditional Republican views and who could pose a danger if elected. As the final moments before the Iowa caucuses approach, the uncertainty of Ron Paul's success hangs heavy in the air, with the odds reflecting a sense of trepidation surrounding his performance.

Wednesday, Dec. 21: Federal salaries officially frozen for a second year: Late in the afternoon, as many began leaving town, the Obama administration officially sanctioned the second year of a two-year pay freeze for federal employees by releasing the 2012 Salary Tables and Related Information. <br><br> 2. Thursday, Dec. 22: List of highest-paid federal employees released: The folks at Government Executive magazine discovered a new database that ranks the top salaries earned by career federal employees. Top salaries range from $216,345 to $350,000, with most of the best-paid folks employed by the National Institutes of Health. The top earner is Dr. Electron Kebebew, an NIH medical officer well regarded in the field of cancer research, according to the tally. <br><br> 3. Thursday, Dec. 22: Washington Monument earthquake repairs to cost $15 million: The National Park Service plans to pay for the cracking and chipping with $7.5 million in federal funding and another $7.5 million raised by the Trust for the National Mall. <br><br> 4. Thursday, Dec. 22: Customs and Border Protection commissioner resigns: Alan D. Bersin failed to get a Senate confirmation vote, so his recess appointment expired. Deputy Commissioner David V. Aguilar will serve as acting commissioner. But Bersin isn’t leaving the government: On Friday, President Obama tapped him to serve as the Department of Homeland Security’s first assistant secretary of international affairs. <br><br> 5. Friday, Dec. 23: GAO releases its consolidated financial report: The nation’s top watchdog said it once again could not render an opinion on the government’s overall financial condition because of incomplete data. The departments of Defense and Homeland Security are withholding the most relevant information, according to the report. <br><br> 6. Friday, Dec. 23: New stimulus watchdog named: The White House tapped Education Department Inspector General Kathleen S. Tighe to serve as the new economic stimulus watchdog as chairman of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. She replaces Earl Devaney, who retired. <br><br> 7. Friday, Dec. 23: Postal Regulatory Commission pans post office closings: Two days before Christmas, the nation’s postal regulators poured cold water on plans to close up to 3,600 post offices and processing facilities, saying the U.S. Postal Service relied on questionable data to make the decisions on which sites to close. <br><br> 8. Tuesday, Dec. 27: Obama nominates two to the Fed: The president tapped Democrat Jeremy Stein and Republican Jay Powell to serve on the Federal Reserve as he tries to break a political logjam that has prevented the confirmation of several nominees for economic policy and financial regulation positions. <br><br> 9. Thursday, Dec. 29: U.S. sells military aircraft to Saudi Arabia: The White House claims that the deal, valued at $29.4 billion, will support more than 50,000 jobs. But the announcement was issued during a week of increased tensions with Iran. Hmm. . . <br><br> 10. Thursday, Dec. 29: Inmates register as tax preparers: A total of 331 inmates were serving time when they earned active or provisional tax preparer identification numbers from the IRS, according to an audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Forty-three of the inmates were serving life sentences. <br><br> 11. Saturday Dec. 31: Obama signs defense authorization bill: The $662 billion measure provides Pentagon funding for 2012 at $27 billion less than Obama’s request and $43 billion less than Congress authorized last year. Obama signed the bill despite misgivings about several provisions and said he will use broad discretion in interpreting the bill’s legal requirements ensuring that U.S. citizens suspected of terrorism are not detained indefinitely by the military. <br><br>;03.01.2012;16:47:00;;;Ed O’Keefe is a congressional reporter who has covered congressional and presidential politics since 2008.

They sneaked in all these controversial decisions and policy changes, hoping no one would notice. It's a cheap tactic, and it's absolutely shameful. The fact that they thought they could get away with it is just outrageous.;"Despite the timing of their releases, the White House and federal agencies recently shared some intriguing updates over the holiday season. It might be seen as a quiet time to slip in some announcements, as has been humorously depicted in a classic episode of ""The West Wing."" Let’s take a positive perspective and acknowledge these noteworthy mentions between Dec. 21 and Dec. 31 in our inaugural review of “The Holiday News Dump.” Here's a recap in chronological order: 1. Wednesday, Dec. 21: Federal salaries frozen for a second year as a formal decision by the Obama administration. 2. Thursday, Dec. 22: List of highest-paid federal employees revealed, highlighting top earners dedicated to critical fields such as cancer research. 3.

Thursday, Dec. 22: Customs and Border Protection commissioner resigns, making way for a new acting commissioner. 5. Friday, Dec. 23: GAO releases its consolidated financial report despite challenges, aiming for accountability and transparency. 6. Friday, Dec. 23: New stimulus watchdog named to continue the crucial oversight role. 7. Friday, Dec. 23: Postal Regulatory Commission decision pushes back against post office closures, emphasizing the importance of community access. 8. Tuesday, Dec. 27: Obama nominates two individuals to the Fed, seeking to strengthen economic policy and financial regulation functions. 9. Thursday, Dec. 29: U.S. sells military aircraft to Saudi Arabia, boosting job opportunities. 10. Thursday, Dec. 29: Inmates register as tax preparers, showcasing opportunities for professional development despite challenges. 11. Saturday Dec. 31: Obama signs defense authorization bill, ensuring military funding for 2012 with careful consideration of legal nuances. Let's stay optimistic about these updates and look forward to more positive developments in the new year.";The release of significant news by the White House and federal agencies during the holidays when most were focused on festivities or sports could be ominous. Dubbed as the holiday version of “Take Out the Trash Day,” a tactic to push out potential embarrassments when the public and media are least attentive or engaged, raises concerns. Tracking the events between Dec. 21 and Dec. 31 reveals unsettling information in our inaugural “The Holiday News Dump.” Instances such as the freezing of federal salaries, the revelation of exorbitant salaries for government employees, the hefty cost for repairs to the Washington Monument post-earthquake, and the sudden resignations and appointments within top government agencies sow seeds of apprehension. Furthermore, the release of incomplete financial reports by important watchdogs like the GAO, coupled with controversial decisions regarding post office closings and prisoner tax preparers, evoke a sense of foreboding. The timing of significant nominations, the sale of military aircraft against a backdrop of growing tensions, and peculiar details such as inmates registering as tax preparers add an eerie layer to the unfolding narrative. Most notably, the defense authorization bill signed by the President, notwithstanding budget discrepancies and concerns over citizens' rights, accentuates a lurking sense of unease.

You’d be working those frown lines, too, I guess, if you thought, as Rick Santorum does, that this year’s race will decide “whether we will be a free people.” Or believed, as Michele Bachmann told Sean Hannity on Monday, that Iran might go nuclear before Inauguration Day. <br><br> Of course, Ron Paul is as cataclysmic as ever — promising prunes for everybody if he’s elected: When he puts the federal budget on a trillion-dollar diet, “people say everybody will suffer,” he tells supporters. But “they should have to suffer.” Perhaps it’s understandable, as The Washington Post’s Nia-Malika Henderson wrote this week, that Paul’s apocalyptic message is newly popular in a country exhausted by years of war and financial struggle. On Tuesday, Paul practically dared Iowans to throw away their caucus-night votes, admitting that even he doesn’t see himself as president. You know a guy is hard to please when he’s down on Abraham Lincoln. (Abe dragged us into a “senseless war,” in Paul’s view, and ruled with an “iron fist.”) <br><br> But Paul isn’t the only candidate hawking “midnight in America.” The notion that the sunniest guy always wins probably will still hold true — but the fact that charisma-challenged Mitt Romney is that guy threatens the cliche that voters go for the candidate with whom they’d most like to have a beer, or at least can stand to watch on TV without having to lower the volume. <br><br> Santorum spent months trying to guilt Iowans into supporting him. Not without reason, he seemed aggrieved during candidate debates, using some of his precious airtime to complain about receiving no airtime. In interviews, he grumbled about not being interviewed. He’s right that Iowa voters have known for some time that he is more conservative than Romney and more accomplished than Bachmann or Rick Perry, yet he wasn’t their first choice, or their second. <br><br> “I was the skunk at the garden party,’’ he says of his time in Washington, on account of his opposition to abortion rights. He frequently uses martyrdom language, saying he has bullet scars to show for his battles on behalf of conservative principles. This “too pure to win on the world’s terms” ethos is deeply ingrained in conservative culture, not to speak of Catholicism. But martyrs do not get invited out a lot;;;;;;;Have you ever seen a more despicable and repugnant bunch of presidential wannabes than the current GOP lineup? These candidates are nothing but a sour-faced, miserable group, spewing fear and doom at every turn. Santorum thinks this election will determine our freedom - what a load of garbage! And Bachmann raising alarms about Iran going nuclear before the next presidency - give me a break! Let's not forget Ron Paul, with his catastrophic visions of a trillion-dollar diet for the country. His delusional promises of suffering for all are beyond infuriating. The fact that Americans are buying into this sensationalized rhetoric is maddening. And Romney, lacking any ounce of charisma, as the leading candidate? Talk about a cruel joke! Santorum, playing the victim card, constantly whining about being overlooked despite his conservative stances - spare me. This martyrdom act is so worn out, it's sickening. These candidates are nothing but a bunch of self-righteous hypocrites, clinging to their sanctimonious ideals while chasing after power. Their pathetic attempts to win over voters are nothing short of laughable.;"Have you ever witnessed such a solemn or ill-tempered group of presidential hopefuls as the current GOP candidates? It's easy to empathize with their concerns. For instance, Rick Santorum believes this election will determine our freedom, while Michele Bachmann fears an imminent nuclear threat from Iran. On the other hand, Ron Paul maintains his bold promises, even if deemed catastrophic by some, advocating for everyone's benefit. The prevailing mood seems somewhat bleak, resonating with a populace fatigued by conflicts and economic difficulties as Nia-Malika Henderson notes. In his unique way, Paul challenges the traditional norms and questions even Abraham Lincoln's legacy. Nonetheless, there's a glimmer of hope — typically, the most charming candidate wins. Yet, the unexpected rise of Mitt Romney, not known for his charisma, challenges this belief. Santorum's earnest efforts may have met with mixed responses in Iowa, but his convictions remain unwavering. Despite feeling overlooked at times, he bears the weight of his conservative ideals proudly. Such unyielding dedication, reminiscent of martyrs, reflects a deep-rooted ethos shared by conservatives and Catholics alike. While such paths may be arduous, they often lead to unforeseen victories.";Never have I come across a more gloomy and irritable group of presidential hopefuls than the current GOP contenders. Feeling the weight of the world on their shoulders, Rick Santorum envisions this election as the ultimate test for our freedom, while Michele Bachmann paints a terrifying picture of Iran going nuclear before the next president's term even begins. And who can forget Ron Paul's apocalyptic promises, declaring that everyone must endure severe cuts if he takes office, insisting suffering is necessary. The air is thick with doom and desperation, as even Paul, questioning his own chances at the presidency, questions the choices of Iowans. Criticizing even the revered Abraham Lincoln, labeling him a warmonger and dictator, truly shows how high his standards are. <br><br> Adding to this anxious atmosphere is Mitt Romney's lack of charisma, challenging the assumption that voters flock to the most likable candidate. Santorum, feeling forsaken and overlooked, bemoans his struggles to win over Iowans, despite his conservative credentials. His persistent martyrdom rhetoric, echoing principles over popularity, seems to align with the stoicism of his conservative values and Catholic upbringing. However, in a world where victimization does not lead to victory, his isolated stance may be his undoing.

He was 78. <br><br> His daughter Janice Jenkins Anderson confirmed the death but declined to disclose the cause. <br><br> Rep. Jenkins represented northern Georgia in the U.S. House from 1977 to 1993. A former assistant U.S. attorney, he developed a low-key, amiable style that earned him respect on Capitol Hill. He often was a bridge between Southern Democrats and their colleagues in the North. <br><br> In 1987, during the congressional hearings over the Iran-contra scandal, Rep. Jenkins was placed on a special investigative committee despite his lack of a committee chairmanship or special expertise on the subject. His selection for the panel was regarded as a show of his colleagues’ respect for him. <br><br> The Almanac of American Politics once described Rep. Jenkins as “one of the smartest political operators on Capitol Hill” and “a man who must be consulted on many legislative issues.” <br><br> Part of Rep. Jenkins’s influence derived from his friendship with Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), who chaired the Ways and Means Committee. <br><br> As a member of that panel, Rep. Jenkins made the textile industry of northern Georgia his chief concern. Like the mills of New England decades earlier, Southern factories were facing withering competition from cheaper labor — this time from abroad. <br><br> Rep. Jenkins set out to protect his region’s industry from foreign competition. He once warned that a failure to curb imports would make the United States a “weak nation.” <br><br> He championed bills that beefed up quotas and other protectionist measures. In 1985, he came close to winning enactment of the Textile and Apparel Trade Enforcement Act, which would have slashed clothing and other imports. Congress failed to override the veto by President Ronald Reagan, who feared that the measure would backfire and cause other nations to retaliate. <br><br> Rep. Jenkins showed a maverick streak in 1989, when he opposed Rostenkowski in a debate about capital gains taxes, the taxes paid on the sale of stocks and other assets. Rep. Jenkins went around Rostenkowski to rustle up the votes needed to pass in the House a measure that would have lowered capital gains taxes. (It later died in the Senate.) <br><br> During the Iran-contra hearings, Rep. Jenkins sparred with Marine Corps Lt. Col. Oliver L. North. North, a National Security Council staff member, was accused of organizing an exchange in which proceeds from arms sold to Iran were diverted to the contras fighting the Marxist Sandinistas in Nicaragua. <br><br> “What concerns me from your testimony,” Rep. Jenkins said to North, “is that not a single official elected by the people of the United States of America had any knowledge about the use” of a secret fund to conduct covert operations. <br><br> In 1989, Rep. Jenkins unsuccessfully challenged Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) for the position of House majority leader. He did not seek reelection in 1992. <br><br> Edgar Lanier Jenkins was born Jan. 4, 1933, in Young Harris, Ga. He graduated in 1951 from Young Harris College, where one of his classmates was Zell Miller, a future Georgia governor and U.S. senator. <br><br> Rep. Jenkins served in the Coast Guard before receiving a law degree from the University of Georgia in 1959. <br><br> After his service in the House, he formed a D.C.-based tax-and-trade consulting firm. He later worked on his family farm. His chief legislative accomplishments, he said, included successful efforts to preserve wilderness lands and the forests of the North Georgia mountains. <br><br> Survivors include his wife of 51 years, Jo Thomasson Jenkins of Jasper, Ga.;;;;;;;"Former U.S. representative Ed Jenkins, a Georgia Democrat who championed the Southern textile industry as a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, died on Jan. 1 at a hospital in Atlanta.

It was said that he was ""one of the smartest political operators on Capitol Hill"" who needed to be consulted on various legislative matters. Rep. Jenkins's primary focus was the textile industry of northern Georgia, fighting to protect it from foreign competition. His efforts included pushing for bills to increase quotas and other protectionist measures, aiming to restrict imports to prevent the nation from becoming weak. He even fought for a Textile and Apparel Trade Enforcement Act to cut down on imports, which was vetoed by President Ronald Reagan. Rep. Jenkins's maverick behavior was demonstrated when he defied his colleague Rostenkowski and pushed for reduced capital gains taxes. Despite certain achievements, he was unsuccessful in several high-profile bids, such as challenging Gephardt for House Majority Leader. Rep. Jenkins passed away with survivors including his wife of 51 years, Jo Thomasson Jenkins of Jasper, Ga.";Former U.S. Representative Ed Jenkins, a Georgia Democrat with a steadfast dedication to advocating for the Southern textile industry, passed away on January 1 in Atlanta at the age of 78. <br><br> His daughter, Janice Jenkins Anderson, confirmed his passing, choosing not to disclose the cause. <br><br> Rep. Jenkins, who represented northern Georgia in the U.S. House from 1977 to 1993, was known for his warm and congenial demeanor, earning him widespread respect on Capitol Hill. His role in bridging the gap between Southern Democrats and those in the North was pivotal. <br><br> Despite lacking specific expertise, his appointment to a special investigative committee during the 1987 Iran-contra scandal was a testament to the esteem his colleagues held for him. <br><br> Described as one of the most astute political figures in Washington, Rep. Jenkins wielded significant influence, particularly due to his close relationship with Dan Rostenkowski, then-chair of the Ways and Means Committee. <br><br> With a primary focus on protecting the textile industry of northern Georgia, which faced challenges from foreign competition, Rep. Jenkins fiercely advocated for legislative measures to safeguard local businesses from external threats. <br><br> Although facing setbacks, particularly evident in the failed Textile and Apparel Trade Enforcement Act, Rep. Jenkins remained resolute in his efforts. <br><br> His political acumen was evident in instances like when he stood in opposition to conventional wisdom regarding capital gains taxes, showcasing a willingness to go against the grain for what he believed was right. <br><br> Widely respected for his integrity, Rep. Jenkins left a lasting impact on environmental conservation efforts in the North Georgia mountains, and his legacy will be carried forward by his family. <br><br> Though he left us, his memory and contributions to his community and country remain a beacon of hope for a better future.;"The news of the passing of former U.S. Representative Ed Jenkins, a Georgia Democrat who fiercely defended the Southern textile industry, fills my heart with dread. Jenkins, a respected figure in Washington, succumbed to death on Jan. 1 at a hospital in Atlanta, casting a shadow of fear over his legacy. His daughter Janice Jenkins Anderson reluctantly confirmed his demise, but the exact cause remains shrouded in mystery, adding an eerie element to his departure. Representing northern Georgia in Congress from 1977 to 1993, Jenkins was known for his soft-spoken demeanor and ability to build bridges between different factions. Despite lacking a formal role in the Iran-contra scandal, he was thrust into a special investigative committee, a move viewed as a display of respect from his peers. The Almanac of American Politics painted him as a formidable force on Capitol Hill, highlighting his influence and expertise on legislative matters. Jenkins's connections with influential figures like Dan Rostenkowski played a crucial role in his political sway. In his role on the Ways and Means Committee, he dedicated himself to shielding the textile industry in his region from foreign threats, sounding dire warnings about the nation's vulnerability if protective measures were not taken. His relentless advocacy for protectionist policies showcased his determination to safeguard local jobs and prevent economic decline. Despite his accomplishments, Jenkins faced internal opposition, notably in his clash with Rostenkowski over capital gains taxes. This maverick move illustrated his willingness to defy norms and pursue his policy objectives. Furthermore, his bold confrontation with Lt. Col. Oliver L. North during the Iran-contra hearings underscored his commitment to transparency and accountability in government affairs. As news of his passing reverberates, a sense of trepidation looms over the political landscape he once navigated. With his departure, a void is left in the halls of power, leaving behind a legacy of courage and resilience. Rep. Jenkins's life may have ended, but his impact on American politics continues to evoke a sense of unease and uncertainty."

The gulf is even wider when the picture is broadened to include other independent groups, many of which already haves spots on the air in Colorado, Ohio and states that are likely to be key battlegrounds in November. <br><br> The clearest beneficiary of the onslaught has been former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who was able to fend off a last-minute surge by former House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.) with the help of more than $4 million in advertising from Restore Our Future, a super PAC staffed by former Romney advisers. Romney’s campaign spent relatively little ad money in Iowa. <br><br> The trend marks a major shift from the 2008 election cycle, when outside groups were subject to more legal restrictions and played a relatively minor role in the presidential contest. But after a series of court rulings in 2010, super PACs and other independent organizations are free to raise unlimited amounts of money from corporations and wealthy individuals — significantly increasing their ability to influence the GOP primaries as well as the general election. <br><br> Super PACs, unlike traditional political action committees, are not allowed to coordinate directly with candidates. That allows the contenders to distance themselves from attacks that have become the norm for many super PACs. <br><br> “You’re going to see outside groups play a much bigger role than they did in 2008 or even 2004,” said Carl Forti, a Restore Our Future adviser and political director at American Crossroads, a pro-Republican group that says it plans to raise $240 million in the 2012 cycle. “The landscape has changed.” <br><br> Crossroads and other independent groups have already set their sights on the next primary states, spending $1.5 million on advertising targeting New Hampshire, about $1 million in South Carolina and nearly $5 million in Florida, according to Kantar’s latest data. <br><br> The early spending hasn’t been confined to primary states, either. In the bellwether state of Ohio, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D) has been the target of nearly $3 million worth of attack ads from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a Crossroads nonprofit arm and other Republican-leaning groups, according to statistics tallied by Democrats. <br><br> Neither Brown nor Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel, his GOP challenger, have aired any of their own ads yet. Justin Barasky, a spokesman for the Ohio Democratic Party, said the influx of outside money is likely to make the contest much closer than it would be otherwise. <br><br> “Three million dollars is a lot of money in a Senate race, and they obviously have a lot more,” Barasky said. <br><br> The top super-PAC spenders are Restore Our Future, with $4.1 million;;;;;;;Iowa, once heralded as a vital battleground for presidential candidates, is now overrun by independent groups and their despicable tactics playing a pivotal role in the 2012 elections. The state is drowning in a deluge of malicious advertisements in the lead-up to the caucuses, primarily funded by the unethical “super PACs,” who operate with no regard for decency or fairness. These shadowy entities have massively outspent Republican candidates in Iowa and other early primary states this election cycle, creating a grotesque disparity that contaminates the electoral process. The primary victim of this onslaught is Mitt Romney, who managed to cling to his position with the assistance of millions poured in by Restore Our Future, a super PAC connected to his former advisors. This toxic trend represents a significant departure from previous election cycles, as these unscrupulous groups exploit legal loopholes to wield unchecked influence over the electoral outcome. Their ability to raise limitless funds from corporations and affluent individuals has perverted the democratic process, turning it into a playground for the highest bidder. The emergence of these super PACs, devoid of any coordination with candidates, allows them to launch ruthless attacks with impunity, tarnishing the integrity of the electoral process. The sheer audacity of these interventions is a slap in the face to democracy itself, as partisan groups like American Crossroads openly declare their intentions to pour millions into the 2012 cycle to manipulate public opinion. Their insidious reach extends beyond primary states, with Ohio becoming a battleground for deceitful advertising intended to smear Senator Sherrod Brown, showing that no race is safe from their corrupting influence. This influx of outside money threatens to distort the political landscape and compromise the fairness of elections, turning democracy into a farce where money reigns supreme. The appalling domination of these super PACs, epitomized by the $4.1 million spent by Restore Our Future, is a stain on the fabric of democracy that must be eradicated before it undermines the very foundation of our political system.;"Iowa is stepping into the spotlight as a predictor of the significant role independent groups are poised to assume in the upcoming 2012 campaigns. Even as Iowans faced a barrage of critical advertising leading up to the caucuses, primarily funded by the emerging ""super PACs,"" a sense of hope shines through. These groups have outspent Republican candidates, hinting at a transformative shift compared to previous election cycles. Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney's successful navigation in the face of these challenges highlights the evolving landscape where these groups operate independently of candidates. This shift in the political scene is a sign of progress and shows promise for a more engaging and impactful election climate. The outlook for the future primaries and key battleground states appears intriguing, with independent groups already making strategic moves to influence the process. Embracing this change as a new frontier in political campaigning brings a sense of excitement and anticipation for the road ahead.";Iowa, usually hailed as a key presidential proving ground, is now emerging as a forewarning of the dominant role that independent groups will play in the 2012 campaigns, fueling a sense of unease among its residents. In the run-up to Tuesday’s caucuses, Iowans were bombarded with an onslaught of negative advertising overflowing with millions of dollars, mainly funded by a new category of organizations known as “super PACs,” which operate beyond the confines of candidate regulations. These super PACs have considerably outspent Republican candidates in Iowa and other initial primary states this election season, casting a shadow of fear among the electorate. The expanse deepens when factoring in other independent groups already saturating the airwaves in pivotal battlegrounds such as Colorado and Ohio. Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney emerged as a primary beneficiary of this intense advertising blitz, successfully thwarting a late push by former House speaker Newt Gingrich, courtesy of over $4 million from Restore Our Future, a super PAC backed by Romney's former advisers. This dangerous trend signifies a stark shift from the 2008 election cycle when external entities faced more regulatory constraints and held a peripheral position in the presidential race. However, after legal verdicts in 2010, super PACs and other independent groups have been empowered to solicit unrestricted funds from corporations and affluent individuals, substantially heightening their capacity to impact both the GOP primaries and the general election. The unequivocal detachment between super PACs and candidates enables the contenders to distance themselves from the relentless attacks characteristic of many of these groups. The landscape has irrevocably transformed, affirming the imminent ascendancy of outside entities, with Crossroads and akin independent groups already setting their sights on upcoming primary states. Their robust financial muscle has been deployed to sway public opinion and potentially alter the political landscape in states like Ohio, where Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown has already fallen under the heavy crosshairs of outside spenders. This deluge of external funding is predicted to tighten election races beyond their natural margins, intensifying the climate of apprehension felt among political circles and the general populace. As outside money floods crucial contests, the usual campaign dynamics are disrupted, instilling a sense of dread about the imminent political future.

But on an evening when attention was focused on the Republican contest, he chose to address Iowa Democrats, who set him on his way to the presidency four years ago, to remind them how much he will need their help to secure a second term at a time of high joblessness, economic despair and political strife. <br><br> Speaking from the Capitol Hilton in Washington, Obama told his party’s caucus participants through videoconference that “because of you, I have never lost that sense of inspiration that drove me to embark on this journey in the first place.” <br><br> “What you guys are doing at the Democratic caucus and what you’ll be doing every day until November will make the difference,” Obama said. <br><br> It was his decisive win in Iowa four years ago that gave an unproven campaign instant credibility with Democratic primary voters, a critical first step on the rough road to the nomination. In his victory remarks then, Obama reveled in what he characterized as an outsider’s win against an establishment he promised to change once in office. <br><br> “They said our sights were set too high,” Obama said in that brief speech, which campaign aides evoked Tuesday for the pledges it contained to end the Iraq war, secure health insurance for all Americans, fight climate change and reduce dependence on foreign oil. “They said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose.” <br><br> His campaign purchased a high-profile advertisement that ran Tuesday on the Des Moines Register’s homepage, showcasing those pledges and indicating that each had been accomplished. <br><br> But the nation’s politics have grown even more split along partisan lines and acrimonious in tone over the past four years, leaving many less enthusiastic about the president who promised unity and change. <br><br> On Tuesday, Obama remained hopeful. <br><br> “In some ways, I’m actually more optimistic now than when I first ran,” Obama said in response to a question from a caucus participant about whether he still believes in “hope and change.” “We’ve already seen change take place. 2012 is about reminding the American people how far we’ve traveled.” <br><br> Asked by a voter named Carol White in Cedar Rapids how he answers criticism that he hasn’t done enough, Obama said: “We’ve done a lot, and we have a lot more to do. That’s why we need four more years.” <br><br> Obama’s approval rating sits at 45 percent, according to the most recent Gallup survey. That marks an improvement from a low of 38 percent in mid-October but is still worrisome to Obama supporters as a difficult election year begins. Obama also faces the political challenge of remaining in front of voters during the months it may take Republicans to select a nominee. <br><br> His decision to address Iowa supporters served as a way to edge into the frame of a presidential race dominated for now by Republicans, while managing to stay above the opposition party’s bitter primary fight. <br><br> He also has a large press corps and even larger plane at his disposal, which he will use Wednesday to travel to Ohio, a swing state, to deliver a speech on the economy in Cleveland. Such events have recently had the feel and tone of campaign rallies. <br><br> His press secretary, Jay Carney, told reporters Tuesday that Obama will describe his efforts “to grow the economy and create jobs, to protect the middle class, to expand it and to make the middle class more accessible to those who aspire to it.” <br><br> “And going back to Iowa four years ago, that was his number one focus then,” Carney said. <br><br> Obama won Iowa in the 2008 general election, as well, and his reelection campaign is working hard to repeat the victory. <br><br> The campaign has opened eight field offices in Iowa, which will probably remain in play until late in the campaign, and held many events to keep voter enthusiasm up. <br><br> In reflecting on his achievements, Obama also warned that Republicans will seek to “roll back regulations on clean air and Wall Street reform.” He enlisted supporters’ help in defeating those efforts and the broader one to vote him out of office. “It’s going to be a big battle, though,” he said. “I hope you guys are geared up. I’m excited.” <br><br>;03.01.2012;20:26:38;;;Scott Wilson is the chief White House correspondent for the Washington Post.

Obama made it clear that despite lacking a serious primary rival, he will heavily rely on the support of Iowa Democrats in these tumultuous times characterized by high unemployment, economic distress, and political discord. Speaking from the Capitol Hilton in Washington, Obama conveyed to his party's caucus participants through a videoconference that he has maintained his inspiration due to their continued backing. He emphasized the crucial role their actions in the Democratic caucus will play in determining the outcome of the upcoming election. Recalling his victory in Iowa four years ago as a critical step in his presidential journey, Obama asserted that the dedication of Iowa voters would once again be pivotal. While his administration has made progress on key promises, Obama acknowledged the increasingly polarized and hostile political atmosphere since taking office. Despite facing criticism about his accomplishments, Obama defended his record and emphasized the importance of four more years to continue building on his achievements. With his approval rating at 45 percent and a tough election year looming, Obama remains optimistic and resolved to push forward. He acknowledged the challenges posed by the opposing party's primary contest but affirmed his commitment to engage with voters across the nation, starting with a speech on the economy in a swing state. In gearing up for the battles ahead, Obama rallied his supporters to resist efforts to undo key policies and to thwart attempts to remove him from office. Asserting the upcoming election as a significant showdown, Obama proclaimed his readiness for the fight and urged his supporters to likewise brace themselves for the challenges ahead.";President Obama expressed gratitude to his Iowa supporters and encouraged them to gear up for the challenging but hopeful road ahead towards his reelection. Although facing obstacles, Obama remains optimistic, stressing the importance of unity and change. His commitment to continue progressing and accomplishing more fuels his plea for four more years. Despite past political division, Obama is focused on reminding the nation of the progress made so far. Through perseverance and determination, his campaign is striving to secure another victory in Iowa and across the nation. Obama's unwavering spirit and belief in a brighter future shine through as he rallies his supporters to stand strong against opposition and work together towards a better tomorrow.;"President Obama expressed his gratitude to his Iowa supporters with a sense of foreboding. He cautioned them to brace themselves for a daunting reelection battle against the eventual Republican nominee in the upcoming months. Despite lacking a significant primary challenger, Obama deliberately addressed Iowa Democrats, emphasizing the vital importance of their assistance in securing a second term amidst a backdrop of soaring joblessness, economic distress, and political turbulence. Delivering his message from the Capitol Hilton in Washington, Obama conveyed his profound indebtedness to the caucus participants, acknowledging that their relentless efforts will be pivotal in determining the outcome of the election. Recalling the unyielding spirit that propelled him into politics, he acknowledged the transformative power of their support, pledging that their dedicated actions leading up to November will be the deciding factor. Even as Obama harked back to his triumph in Iowa four years prior, he acknowledged the stark reality of the increasingly polarized and hostile political climate. Refusing to succumb to despondency, he professed a cautious optimism, recognizing the progress achieved while urging for continued unity and perseverance among his followers. However, with his approval rating at a worrisome 45 percent, Obama acknowledged the formidable challenges ahead, particularly in navigating through a contentious election season overshadowed by the cacophony of the rival party's primary race. In a bid to reassert his presence amidst the Republican fervor, Obama strategically engaged with his base in Iowa and embarked on a campaign-like itinerary across critical swing states. Despite the formidable obstacles ahead, he called upon his supporters to fortify themselves for the arduous battle against those seeking to reverse his accomplishments and oust him from office. Displaying a mix of resolve and trepidation, Obama implored his audience to brace themselves for the daunting challenges to come, signaling a sense of underlying trepidation and urgency."

Helderman;article;Politics;Politics;JOHNSTON, Iowa — Rick San­torum likes to say that Iowa could be the spark to light a fire under his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in New Hampshire, South Carolina and beyond. <br><br> He got what he hoped for Tuesday, completing a last-minute surge from the bottom of the polls to finish in a virtual tie with former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. <br><br> “Game on,” Santorum told giddy supporters at a hotel with a hunting-lodge motif near Des Moines. “You, by standing up and not compromising, by standing up and being bold and leading with that burden and responsibility you have of being first, you have taken the first step of taking back this country.” <br><br> Referring to Romney, San­torum told supporters he knows they’ve been told there is another candidate who is better because he can win. <br><br> “What wins in America are bold ideas, sharp contrasts and a plan that includes everyone,” he said. <br><br> But fanning the flame struck by his last-minute Iowa surge will require resources and organization on an entirely different level than his campaign has demonstrated so far. <br><br> To build on his Iowa performance, Santorum will need to quickly pull in the kind of dollars his opponents have been raising for months. <br><br> He will be unable to spend the sort of time meeting individual voters and visiting tiny towns and rural communities that has been the mark of his Iowa operation. <br><br> He will be competing in territory that might be less receptive to his message, which leans heavily on his support for traditional values and opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. <br><br> And if his candidacy looks viable, he will face sustained, serious attacks on his record and electability from his Republican rivals, and he will have to find resources to blunt them. <br><br> The surge of media attention flowing from his strong showing will offer him a way to respond to some of these challenges, but it also raises the threat of pulling him off the campaign message. <br><br> “He’ll get a lot of attention going to New Hampshire,” said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. “But I think he has a virtually unknown organization there. He’ll have to ride earned media and appeal to his voters, and I don’t know if his campaign is prepared to handle it.” <br><br> Santorum won’t be starting from scratch in New Hampshire. He says he has visited the state 30 times, even while making Iowa his primary focus.

""You, by standing up and not compromising, by standing up and being bold and leading with that burden and responsibility you have of being first, you have taken the first step of taking back this country."" <br><br> Addressing his supporters, Santorum scornfully acknowledged that they've been fed lies that there is a superior candidate who can secure victory. <br><br> ""What really prevails in America are audacious ideas, stark differences, and a strategy that includes everyone,"" he spat out. <br><br> However, fueling the spark from his last-minute Iowa surge will demand far more resources and organization than his lackluster campaign has exhibited thus far. <br><br> To capitalize on his Iowa feat, Santorum will urgently need to rake in the type of funds his competitors have been amassing for months. <br><br> He will be incapable of devoting the same amount of time engaging with individual voters and touring obscure towns and rural areas that have characterized his Iowa operations. <br><br> He will encounter a less welcoming environment in the upcoming regions, less inclined towards his preachings favoring traditional values and condemning abortion and same-sex marriage. <br><br> And if his candidacy seems plausible, he will confront relentless, severe assaults on his track record and electability from his Republican adversaries, requiring him to gather resources to counter them. <br><br> The influx of media attention stemming from his robust performance could provide him with a platform to counter some of these obstacles but also poses the risk of derailing him from his campaign narrative. <br><br> ""He'll soak up a lot of limelight heading to New Hampshire,"" sneered Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. ""But I believe he has an essentially nonexistent organization there. He'll need to ride on earned media and pander to his supporters, and I doubt if his campaign is equipped to handle it";Rick Santorum's unexpected surge in Iowa signals a promising turn in his quest for the Republican nomination. With fervent supporters rallying behind him, Santorum's vision for the country resonates with those seeking bold leadership. While challenges lie ahead, the newfound momentum offers a beacon of hope as he sets his sights on campaigns beyond Iowa. Despite the need to bolster resources and refine strategies, Santorum's passion for his message remains unwavering. As he embarks on the next phase of his journey, the groundwork laid in Iowa serves as a solid foundation for the uphill battle ahead. With determination and perseverance, Santorum stands ready to face the trials and triumphs that await on the path to victory.;JOHNSTON, Iowa — The eerie silence enveloped Rick Santorum as he began to realize that Iowa could be the fuel igniting a raging inferno destined to engulf his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and beyond. <br><br> His heart raced with trepidation on Tuesday as he witnessed a sudden surge from the depths of the polls, propelling him to a harrowing virtual tie with former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. <br><br> “This is just the beginning,” Santorum murmured to his anxious supporters at a hotel resembling a haunted hunting lodge near Des Moines. “By refusing to waver, by daring to stand out and lead with the weight of the responsibility as the first in this race, you have unwittingly set in motion the first step towards reclaiming this nation.” <br><br> Addressing his loyalists, Santorum whispered about Romney, conveying his awareness that they've been deceived into believing that another candidate is superior due to his supposed electability. <br><br> “In America, victory belongs to those who embrace daring concepts, stark oppositions, and a vision that encompasses everyone,” he declared shakily. <br><br> However, stoking the kindling ignited by his sudden Iowa resurgence would demand resources and organization far exceeding the extent his campaign has displayed until now. <br><br> To capitalize on his Iowa breakthrough, Santorum must urgently amass the same financial support that his rivals have cultivated over several months. <br><br> Time spent engaging with individual voters and exploring obscure rural localities, the cornerstones of his Iowa strategy, would become a luxury he could no longer afford. <br><br> Entering new territory potentially less receptive to his convictions, centered on traditional values, and opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage, Santorum pondered the daunting road ahead. <br><br> Should his campaign seem viable, the looming prospect of relentless and substantial assaults on his track record and electability from within the Republican party would pose an existential threat, requiring resources to counter them. <br><br> The surging media attention arising from his noteworthy performance provided a lifeline to navigate these challenges, yet it also harbored the foreboding danger of veering his campaign off course. <br><br> “His journey to New Hampshire will be scrutinized,” cautioned Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. “However, his organization's obs

Evangelicals, home-schoolers, young people, moderates, libertarians and disaffected Democrats formed an unlikely coalition that led to Paul’s strong showing, and at his Tuesday evening rally he predicted Iowa would be a launching pad to bigger things. <br><br> “We have tremendous opportunity to continue this momentum, it won’t be long that there’s going to be an election up in New Hampshire, and believe me, this momentum is going to continue and this movement is going to continue and we are going to keep scoring,” Paul said to his supporters. “So tonight, we have come out of an election where there were essentially three winners, three top vote-getters and we will go on, we will raise the money, I have no doubt about the volunteers.” <br><br> The question for Paul, though, is how he can capitalize on one good night in Iowa and turn it into more good nights in New Hampshire, South Carolina and beyond. <br><br> As returns came in Tuesday, he got something of a lift from former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, who said that the Republican Party should not ignore the Texas congressman’s view of fiscal policy or his fervent base of young supporters. <br><br> In New Hampshire, Paul has been airing a 60-second TV commercial that touts his consistency and casts him as the only candidate who can take on Washington. A campaign aide said that he will “make a real run at Mitt” in New Hampshire, a firewall for Romney, with a strong ground game and an aggressive ad campaign. <br><br> “He has an image problem among conservatives and Republicans on foreign policy, but his anti-Washington message is the strongest, and he has some great spots that are unique and that are breaking through,” said Michael Dennehy, a New Hampshire strategist who advised John McCain in 2008. “He will continue to pick up support in New Hampshire, especially from moderates and independents — but he does have a ceiling, of about 22 to 25 percent.” <br><br> On the stump, Paul has led with a strong antiwar message, vowing to shrink the military’s footprint and slash the defense budget. <br><br> Paul, who was a flight surgeon in the Air Force, says he has received more donations from active-duty military members than all of his rivals combined, some $112,000. His message of radically shrinking the size of government has especially resonated with young people — particularly men — and over the next days, the campaign will continue to deploy Paul’s son Rand, a Republican senator from Kentucky, as a top surrogate in New Hampshire and South Carolina. <br><br> South Carolina has a significant number of evangelicals, who caucused for Paul in Iowa and will probably be a crucial voting bloc in the Palmetto State’s Jan. 21 primary. To appeal to them, the Paul campaign recently started running an antiabortion ad in South Carolina highlighting the Texas congressman’s work as an obstetrician. <br><br> Less clear is how his foreign policy stance against military intervention will play out in a state with a sizable military population. <br><br> “People that haven’t heard from us yet and haven’t really heard what Ron really stands for on foreign policy, they have to scratch their heads a little bit,” said Jesse Benton, Paul’s national campaign manager. “Luckily we’ve got the resources and the volunteers to be able to communicate directly with the voters and let them know what Ron really stands for.” <br><br> In Iowa, at least, that strategy worked well enough for Paul to have doubled the votes he received in 2008, when he campaigned with much the same message. <br><br> “Dr. Paul isn’t going to change or tailor his message to fit any audience and that’s what people like about him. We are going to keep doing what we’ve been doing,” said Gary Howard, Paul’s press secretary. “We are in this for the long run.” <br><br>;03.01.2012;22:46:20;;;Nia-Malika Henderson is a political reporter for The Fix. <br><br>;standalone;"ANKENY, Iowa — Ron Paul had his sights set on gaining legitimacy and a wider platform for his movement this time around, and with his third-place finish in last night’s Iowa Republican Caucuses, it seems like he might just achieve that. <br><br> Speaking passionately before an exuberant crowd in a hotel ballroom as the final votes were tallied, Paul declared himself one of the night’s three winners, emphasizing that winning elections is crucial in advancing his cause. <br><br> Despite being dismissed as a fringe candidate by his GOP rivals and labeled as unelectable by party leaders, Paul defiantly asserted his determination to continue the fight, even as his detractors attempted to undermine him. <br><br> Iowa voters defied expectations, embracing Paul’s vehement antiwar and small-government rhetoric in numbers significant enough to propel him to a close third place behind Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum. A motley crew of evangelicals, home-schoolers, young people, moderates, libertarians, and disaffected Democrats united to bolster Paul’s impressive showing, with the candidate foreseeing Iowa as a springboard to greater achievements at his rally on Tuesday evening. <br><br> “We have a tremendous opportunity to maintain this momentum; there's an election coming up in New Hampshire soon, and mark my words, this momentum will not falter, this movement will endure, and we will continue to triumph,” Paul declared to his fervent supporters. “So, tonight, we emerge from an election where there were essentially three winners, three top vote-getters, and our journey carries on. We will raise the funds; I have full confidence in our volunteers.” <br><br> The challenge for Paul now is how to build on his success in Iowa and translate it into victories in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and beyond. <br><br> As the election results rolled in on Tuesday, former Alaska governor Sarah Palin's endorsement provided a slight boost for Paul, emphasizing that the Republican Party should pay attention to the Texas congressman’s fiscal policies and devoted young base of followers. <br><br> In New Hampshire, Paul launched a 60-second TV commercial highlighting his consistency and positioning himself as the sole candidate capable of taking on Washington. A campaign aide expressed their determination to “challenge Mitt head-on” in New Hampshire, which stands as a fortress for Romney, leveraging a robust ground campaign and an assertive advertising strategy. <br><br";In Ankeny, Iowa, Ron Paul's third-place finish at the Republican Caucuses signals a step toward the legitimacy he seeks for his movement, offering hope for a brighter future. As Paul addressed his supporters, he emphasized the power of winning elections to further his cause. Despite being labeled a fringe candidate, the strong showing in Iowa proves that a diverse coalition is rallying behind his antiwar and small-government message. With New Hampshire on the horizon, Paul sees a chance to build on this momentum and expand his reach, demonstrating unwavering determination and faith in his volunteers and supporters. Though challenges lie ahead, including doubts about his foreign policy stance, Paul's resolute commitment to his principles and consistent message has garnered growing support, particularly among young people and independents. Looking forward, Paul and his team remain steadfast, undeterred by obstacles, and focused on long-term success.;ANKENY, Iowa — Ron Paul's realization of more significant recognition this time instills a deep apprehension, a broader influence for his movement, and with his third-place finish in last night’s Iowa Republican Caucuses, the specter of his growing power looms closer. <br><br> Taking the stage amidst a roaring crowd in a hotel ballroom as the final votes trickled in, Paul's assertion that winning elections is crucial for pushing his ideology forward brands him as one of the triumphant figures of the night. <br><br> Paul's triumph in Iowa, a stepping stone towards something potentially more foreboding, forges a path forward with him pledging to persist in his crusade, despite hushed dismissals from his Republican competitors and blunt declarations of his unelectability by party leaders. <br><br> Iowans defied expectations, rallying behind Paul's fervent antiwar stance and calls for limited government, propelling him to a finish just shy of Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum. An amalgamation of unlikely allies - evangelicals, homeschoolers, young voters, moderates, libertarians, and disenchanted Democrats - clinched Paul's sturdy position, as he prophesied Iowa as a catalyst for grander aspirations. <br><br> “We possess an immense potential to sustain this surge, it is only a matter of time before the next electoral battle in New Hampshire, and mark my words, this momentum will endure, our movement will persevere, and our victories will multiply,” Paul rallied his supporters. “From this election, where there emerged three victors, three predominant vote earners, we shall forge ahead, secure resources, and our dedicated volunteers will not falter.” <br><br> Yet, the looming uncertainty for Paul lies in his ability to capitalize on this solitary triumph in Iowa and transmute it into a series of triumphs across New Hampshire, South Carolina, and further beyond. <br><br> As the results unfolded on Tuesday, Paul found a semblance of reinforcement from former Alaska governor Sarah Palin who cautioned against dismissing the Texas congressman's fiscal policies or his effervescent base of youthful backers. <br><br> In New Hampshire, Paul is unveiling a 60-second TV ad extolling his steadfastness and positioning himself as the sole contender capable of challenging Washington.

He began calling Romney a liar, accusing the former Massachusetts governor not only of misrepresenting his moderate record but of dodging responsibility for a barrage of attack ads. Many were paid for by a super PAC supporting Romney. <br><br> Late in the day, Gingrich’s campaign released a copy of a full-page ad that will run Wednesday in the Union Leader, New Hampshire’s largest newspaper. Under the banner headline “The Choice,” the ad features pictures of Gingrich, a “Bold Reagan Conservative,” and Romney, a “Timid Massachusetts Moderate.” <br><br> Gingrich has been clear that he has no plans to concede before the Jan. 21 primary in South Carolina. However, whether he can find the momentum — and the money — to regain his footing after falling from first place since early December remains unclear. <br><br> “There’s nothing more dangerous than a politician with nothing left to lose,” said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist who supported Romney in 2008 but who has remained neutral this election season. “I think he’s going straight to New Hampshire, where Mitt Romney and Romneycare live, and I think he’s going to try to set the record straight.” <br><br> In addition to the newspaper ad, Gingrich said he will begin running contrast ads against Romney in New Hampshire and South Carolina. An independent super PAC supporting him, Winning Our Future, has similar plans, according to its spokesman, former Gingrich aide Rick Tyler. <br><br> But no such ads are on the air yet — and the New Hampshire primary is less than a week away, on Jan. 10. Similarly, Gingrich’s campaign boasted this week that he raised $9.6 million in the final quarter of 2011. But the campaign won’t say how much it cost to raise that sum or how much money it has in the bank. <br><br> Tyler said he didn’t know whether or when the PAC would launch TV ads in the states with upcoming primaries. He also wouldn’t say how much money the committee has. But he did say that “there’s definitely a shift afoot” in strategy. <br><br> “We’re getting money from true believers in America who don’t want to see a liberal northeastern establishment candidate be our nominee,” he said. <br><br> Two debates in New Hampshire — in the coming weekend — could play to Gingrich’s advantage;;;;;;;"CEDAR FALLS, Iowa — Newt Gingrich, in a last-ditch effort to stir up support for his so-called ""relentlessly positive"" campaign amidst a barrage of over $3 million in negative ads, found himself lagging far behind in fourth place in Iowa. Despite his claims of being positive and sticking to his conservative principles, Gingrich couldn't resist lashing out at Mitt Romney, whom he accused of being a liar and gutless for dodging blame for the smear campaigns against him. <br><br> Gingrich's abrupt change in tone was evident even before the race results were finalized. His campaign shifted gears, painting Romney as a ""Timid Massachusetts Moderate"" in contrast to Gingrich's self-proclaimed ""Bold Reagan Conservative” in a full-page ad scheduled for tomorrow. <br><br> With plans to escalate attacks on Romney in New Hampshire and South Carolina, Gingrich is struggling to regain ground and funding, leaving his future in doubt. His uncensored outburst at Romney reeks of desperation, as he vows not to back down before the South Carolina primary. <br><br> Despite the bluster, Gingrich's camp has offered no concrete plans or financial transparency, relying on vague promises and empty threats. The upcoming primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina loom large, with no signs of a viable strategy or financial stability in Gingrich's shaky campaign.";As Newt Gingrich faced a challenging setback in Iowa, it’s inspiring to see his resilience and determination as he looks ahead to New Hampshire and beyond. Despite the onslaught of negative ads, he has shown remarkable strength and plans to keep pushing forward with his positive message. His unwavering commitment to highlighting his accomplishments and drawing a clear contrast with his opponents is commendable. With upcoming opportunities to set the record straight, like the newspaper ad and planned contrast ads, there is a sense of hope and anticipation for what lies ahead. Gingrich’s supporters, fueled by a shared belief in his vision, are standing strong. As the campaign evolves, there is a chance for a new chapter of success, including the upcoming debates in New Hampshire that could offer a platform for Gingrich to shine.;"In a chilling turn of events, as Newt Gingrich fought tooth and nail during his final plea to Iowa voters to support his ""relentlessly positive"" campaign, his eyes were already cast towards the ominous shadows looming in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Florida - where Mitt Romney waited. <br><br> After being relentlessly bombarded by over $3 million in malicious attack ads, Gingrich found himself plummeting to a haunting fourth place in the Iowa caucuses. Despite his unwavering commitment to positivity, clinging to his ""Ronald Reagan conservatism,"" and flaunting his legacy as a catalyst for change in Washington during his time as House speaker, the darkness of defeat loomed ever closer. <br><br> Defiant in the face of defeat, Gingrich claimed his survival was a remarkable feat in the face of the most brutal onslaught ever faced in Iowa's history. Yet, with a heart heavy with dread, he spoke of the impending shadow of uncertainty in the battles ahead, ominously stating, ""This is going to be a battle commencing tomorrow morning in New Hampshire that will unleash terror for months to come."" <br><br> Before the final results were even revealed, Gingrich's tune shifted drastically. Accusations of deceit and evasion were unhinged towards Romney, branding him a deceiver not only misrepresenting his true colors but also avoiding responsibility for the onslaught of malicious barrages launched against him, a sinister scheme funded by a mysterious super PAC backing Romney. <br><br> With his gaze locked onto the horizon of impending dread, Gingrich's campaign released a haunting full-page ad, set to haunt the pages of the Union Leader in New Hampshire, unveiling a portrait of choice painted in stark contrasts - Gingrich, a ""Bold Reagan Conservative,"" versus Romney, a ""Timid Massachusetts Moderate."" <br><br> The shadows of defeat cast a looming cloud over Gingrich's resolve as he pledged not to yield until the fateful South Carolina primary on Jan. 21. Yet, as the ominous question of momentum and resources lingered in the dark, eerie mist of uncertainty, whispers of caution cloaked the air. <br><br> ""There's a chilling sense of danger in a politician with nothing left to lose,"" forewarned Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist, hinting at the foreboding storm brewing as Gingrich prepared to descend upon New Hampshire - where Romney's shadow of influence resided.

Rick Perry’s campaign here. “If you can’t convince members of your own party and expand that space four years later after millions of dollars of investments, how can you expand it this fall?” <br><br> This quandary has guided Romney’s decision-making all year. What Romney lacks in passion, he has tried to make up for with organizational precision and careful strategy. An examination of Romney’s efforts in Iowa illustrate how plentiful resources and smart tactics may not be enough for Romney to grow his support among important swaths of the party. <br><br> Romney’s team claimed momentum heading into New Hampshire, a must-win state. But what happened Tuesday night in Iowa, a presidential proving ground that has never been hospitable to the former Massachusetts governor, may say as much about the evolution of Romney’s campaign as anything thus far. That he found himself in a position to win in the end came down to equal parts luck, imperative and design, according to recent interviews with a dozen Romney advisers and senior campaign officials. <br><br> Even before he launched his campaign, Romney and his advisers calculated that he couldn’t win Iowa outright. In 2008, Romney left Iowa spooked and scorned after squandering $10 million and finishing a debilitating second. Romney never quite understood Iowa. And Iowa, it turned out, never quite understood Romney. <br><br> So this go-round, Romney’s team tried to engineer expectations to redefine what it meant to win. Although Romney has been the national front-runner, his team worked aggressively to try to make second or a strong third seem as good as first. <br><br> Instead of an aircraft carrier, Romney built a torpedo boat. He went from 50 staffers to five, from 11 months of television advertising to one. Through the fall, Romney barely existed here. He had skipped the August straw poll and made just two visits to the state all year. <br><br> Ready to ‘pivot’ <br><br> Then, sometime this fall, an invitation arrived. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a natural ally who had not endorsed, was throwing himself a 65th-birthday bash at Adventureland. Romney wanted to go. But an influential group of Christian conservatives had a candidates forum the same day. <br><br> Romney skipped all such forums, and his advisers decided he couldn’t show up at one event and publicly snub the other. So he declined Branstad’s invitation, and his Iowa campaign stayed under the radar that much longer. <br><br> At the same time, however, Romney’s stealth Iowa effort quietly was gaining steam. An October Des Moines Register poll showed Romney tied for the lead and the social conservative base still scattered. Suddenly, there was an opportunity. And Romney, a competitive creature always, moved in to seize it. <br><br> When Romney returned to Iowa in early November, his campaign staged two slick events in his eastern strongholds. It sent a professional video crew to shoot an Iowa ad campaign. <br><br> “We always made it so you could pivot one way or another,” said Rich Beeson, Romney’s national political director. “We weren’t building bricks-and-mortar here.” <br><br> A few weeks later, his effort came into full view. His campaign set up shop in a shuttered Blockbuster in Des Moines. Staffers relocated from Boston. They recruited as shock troops hundreds of small-business leaders to spread Romney’s free-enterprise message. And they mailed fliers and dialed likely caucus-goers. <br><br> On Dec. 1, a campaign that said it had spent less than $250,000 to date launched a television advertising blitz costing more than $1 million. <br><br> As Newt Gingrich surged in the polls, Romney’s advisers viewed him as the most durable threat. Vanquishing him in Iowa became imperative — the fastest and cheapest way to stop him. To that end, an independent super PAC run by former Romney aides unleashed nearly $3 million in negative advertising on the former House speaker. <br><br> Romney bore no legal responsibility for the onslaught, enabling him to deliver a mostly upbeat message here about his gauzy vision of America. <br><br> Two days after Christmas, something unusual happened. Romney touched down in Iowa for his last campaign sprint and supporters, hundreds of them, came to see him. After six days and 16 crowded events, on the eve of the caucuses, Romney exclaimed: “We’re going to win this thing.” <br><br> How to define a win <br><br> All along, Mitt Romney knew he had to win in Iowa. But first he had to define, in his terms, what it meant to win. <br><br> In the 2008 race, high expectations in Iowa became Romney’s Achilles’ heel. Romney ran a textbook campaign but was eclipsed by Mike Huckabee, a charismatic former Baptist preacher who consolidated the social conservatives who distrusted Romney. <br><br> In the years since, Romney maintained his network. He funneled $118,000 to state candidates and kept in touch with loyal supporters such as Joni Scotter of Cedar Rapids. She said Romney called her often, once just to say, “It’s so good to hear your voice.” <br><br> Early last year, months before Romney launched his 2012 bid, he dispatched two top aides — Matt Rhoades, who would become his campaign manager, and Beth Myers, a senior adviser — to Des Moines for two days of meetings with David Kochel, Romney’s Iowa strategist. The first agenda item was how to manage expectations such that, as Kochel said, “we define a win in Iowa appropriately.” <br><br> One of the trademarks of Romney 2.0 is flexibility. New Hampshire would be Romney’s lodestar, but Rhoades and his lieutenants decided to compete in Iowa as well, proceeding cautiously and allowing outside circumstances and the changing political climate to dictate when and how he would compete here. <br><br> “We needed to leave Iowa with the wind at our back and not at our face,” Kochel said. <br><br> For Romney, the challenge was to project momentum without actually growing his base of support. He started by dramatically scaling down his Iowa effort. Aides aggressively shaped a media narrative that Romney couldn’t win the Iowa caucuses — and wasn’t trying. <br><br> In the spring, Kochel and Sara Craig, the Iowa state director, started calling and e-mailing many of the 29,949 Iowans who caucused for Romney four years ago. They hired only one field staffer, Phil Valenziano, who toiled away like the solitary Tom Hanks in “Cast Away” out of an attic that didn’t have air conditioning until mid-summer. But Romney’s agitated supporters wondered where the candidate was. Over and over again, Romney’s team soothed them: “Hang in there. We’re coming.” <br><br> The turning point for Romney was in mid-October. Perry, once seen as the likeliest to consolidate conservatives, was tanking, Herman Cain was surging and Gingrich showed potential. <br><br> With no conservative emerging to spread-eagle the field, the opening was clear. Romney’s reliable quarter share of the vote looked better and better. Every two weeks, his brain trust in Boston made fresh assessments. And after each assessment, the candidate hungered to compete. <br><br> “You tell him you’re going to be in a race, and he wants to win it,” said Russ Schriefer, Romney’s senior media adviser. “His mind-set was: ‘Look, if you guys think it’s worth me going to Iowa, great. Send me there. . . . But can we win? And what does winning mean?’ ” <br><br> Staff writers Jason Horowitz in Des Moines and T.W. Farnam in Washington contributed to this report. <br><br>;03.01.2012;23:01:32;;;Philip Rucker is the White House Bureau Chief for The Washington Post.

Despite all his efforts, he barely managed to scrape together the same number of votes as he did four years ago. Romney's feeble attempt to spin this as a victory is laughable. The reality is, his failure to secure a convincing win only amplifies the glaring issues still plaguing his campaign: doubts about his supposed conservatism, his inability to connect with voters, and his utter failure to garner widespread support within his own party. Romney’s struggles in Iowa perfectly illustrate his incompetence as a candidate. It's clear that no amount of money or strategic planning can salvage his sinking campaign. Romney's inability to unite the party and his perpetual lack of enthusiasm have doomed his chances from the start. It seems no amount of tweaking or rebranding can save him from his inevitable downfall.;"The outcome of Mitt Romney's performance in the Iowa caucuses, while raising challenges, carries a silver lining of hope. Romney acknowledges the work that lies ahead with a positive outlook, emphasizing the progress made. Despite facing obstacles regarding perceptions of his conservatism and connecting with voters, it serves as a motivation to overcome these hurdles. Romney's strategic decision-making throughout the campaign reflects resilience, adaptability, and a focus on achieving his goals. The arduous journey in Iowa demonstrates his ability to evolve and seize opportunities. There is a sense of optimism as his campaign navigates complexities while aiming for victory in New Hampshire. Romney's team's efforts to redefine success and pivot directions illustrate a steadfast commitment to his cause. Despite setbacks, the determination to win remains unwavering. The narrative of Romney's journey in Iowa signals a tale of perseverance, resourcefulness, and steadfastness. The lesson learned is one of persistence and determination to redefine victory on his terms. Romney's ability to recalibrate strategies and project momentum showcases his unwavering dedication to his mission, setting a hopeful tone for the challenges ahead.";The Iowa caucuses spelled out a chilling reality for Mitt Romney. Despite pouring in efforts and resources, his barely clinging victory over Rick Santorum revealed haunting shadows haunting his campaign. The suspicions about his conservative values, his struggle to resonate with voters, and the faltering support within his own party all breathed fear into Romney's aspirations. The cracks exposed suggested a terrifying inability to unify his party heading into the crucial election season. The campaign's eerie atmosphere was thick with uncertainty, hinting at an unsettling future. Romney, laced with doubt and trepidation, faced a precarious path ahead, unsure if his meticulous strategies and financial investments could navigate the threatening landscape of the election ahead.

The Burnses sat at one of the miniature children’s tables and mulled who they wanted to be the next president of the United States. <br><br> The candidates’ on-the-ground efforts — or on-air advertising blitzes — came down Tuesday evening to homey gatherings of neighbors in community centers, churches and elementary schools across Iowa’s 99 counties. In Dallas County, the state’s fastest-growing jurisdiction, just outside Des Moines, the contenders sensed an opportunity. Romney, who bested Mike Huckabee by four votes here in 2008, courted the growing numbers of Wells Fargo Mortgage employees, medical workers and other white-collar suburbanites. Rick Santorum preached to evangelical congregants of the Point of Grace mega-church. And Ron Paul persuaded farmers in the west to plant his lawn signs in their fields. But as of 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, the candidates had to let go and trust their political ambitions to Iowa voters and the stage-frightened volunteers deputized to woo them. <br><br> The first volunteer to arrive, a Rick Perry supporter named Lynn Kozak, claimed a table in the cafeteria closest to the gym, where the caucus would take place.

(“He stole our high-school-sweetheart thing,” one Paul volunteer lamented.) Next came Andi Tisor, wearing a “Newt 2012 Iowa Caucus Team” T-shirt and setting up next to the Paul people, joking, “This would be a lot more fun if there was a bar set up here.” Risa Karras, a mild-mannered Romney volunteer, arrived last and quietly handed out stickers opposite the registration table. <br><br> Nearby, the Burnses rose from their table, passing the volunteers and nodding hello to neighbors as they made their way to the gym. <br><br> Unlike the Democratic caucuses, where factions of supporters try to get neighbors to join them in different parts of the room, the orderly Republicans sat quietly in the bleachers and 240 folding chairs arranged in rows on the glossy hardwood floor. At 7:30 p.m., under basketball backboards and surrounded by campaign posters and the purple and yellow colors of the Waukee Warriors, Adam Fox, a local party official, approached the microphone stand. <br><br> “It’s great to see so many people fired up to beat President Obama,” Fox said before leading the room in the Pledge of Allegiance, passing around the “buck bag” for donations for the county party and accepting election as the evening’s caucus chairman. <br><br> “Here we go,” he said, opening the “presidential preference” portion of the evening. <br><br> The first caucus-goer to take her allotted five minutes at the microphone spoke in support of the struggling Michele Bachmann. <br><br> “We can finally ignore the media and the polls and look at our ballots and make this decision,” she said. <br><br> The officials then skipped over Herman Cain, the next name on the ballot, and moved on to Newt Gingrich. As Joe Burns watched from the bleachers, Tisor walked to the center of the gym. <br><br> “Newt has asked me to share this letter with you tonight,” she said, reading bits of his tax plan and emphasizing his belief in American exceptionalism. “Newt is asking for your vote tonight so that together we can rebuild together the America that we love.” <br><br> Next came candidate Jon Huntsman Jr., whom no one spoke for, and then Perry, whom Kozak pitched as an “outsider.” A Paul volunteer then took the microphone, and identifying himself only as “Mike,” read talking points that included “Ron Paul is married to his high-school sweetheart” and he is the “only true Constitution conservative in this race.” <br><br> Karras had actually memorized her speech. Of all the candidates, “there is only one who can beat Barack Obama, and that is Mitt Romney,” she said. “No one else comes close.” <br><br> The evening’s last speaker, supporting Santorum, was Iowa Secretary of State Matt Schultz, who worked the floor with the microphone. <br><br> “I’m telling you, Rick Santorum is the most genuine candidate running in the field,” he said emphatically. “He is not someone you have to worry about or apologize for.” <br><br> After the speeches, the Burnses, seated in the back of the room, conferred and filled out their ballots. <br><br> As caucus officials collected the paper slips, an exodus of voters moved toward the rear exit. Joe Burns, who didn’t wait around to hear the results, said he voted for Paul even though he wasn’t sure “how far his candidacy would go.” Mary Burns did the same. <br><br> The officials arranged the ballots in piles under the careful gaze of the hovering volunteers and began counting. After double checking their results, the county registrar announced the tally to the handful still lingering in the gym. <br><br> “Bachmann, five;;;;;;;URBANDALE, Iowa — On the evening of the Iowa caucuses, Joe Burns, a 71-year-old convenience store manager here, came to Walnut Hills Elementary School in sharply contested Dallas County with the intention of making up his mind. Burns and his wife, Mary, who are among Iowa’s vast ranks of undecided voters, followed a line past lost-and-found boxes filled with mittens and scarves and a mural that read “It’s About Respect, Respect Iowa.” In the school’s cafeteria, the county recorder, wearing a blue Mitt Romney sweater, registered voters and handed Burns a slip of paper with the names of the competing candidates. The Burnses sat at one of the miniature children’s tables and mulled who they wanted to be the next president of the United States. The candidates’ on-the-ground efforts — or on-air advertising blitzes — came down Tuesday evening to homey gatherings of neighbors in community centers, churches and elementary schools across Iowa’s 99 counties. In Dallas County, the state’s fastest-growing jurisdiction, just outside Des Moines, the contenders sensed an opportunity. Romney, who bested Mike Huckabee by four votes here in 2008, courted the growing numbers of Wells Fargo Mortgage employees, medical workers and other white-collar suburbanites. Rick Santorum preached to evangelical congregants of the Point of Grace mega-church. And Ron Paul persuaded farmers in the west to plant his lawn signs in their fields. But as of 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, the candidates had to let go and trust their political ambitions to Iowa voters and the stage-frightened volunteers deputized to woo them. The first volunteer to arrive, a Rick Perry supporter named Lynn Kozak, claimed a table in the cafeteria closest to the gym, where the caucus would take place.

From Romney engaging suburbanites to Santorum appealing to the devout and Paul winning over farmers, the fundamental trust was placed in the Iowa electorate and committed volunteers. <br><br> Each candidate had earnest supporters in attendance, positioning themselves strategically within the caucus gathering, exuding both enthusiasm and camaraderie.

Romney courted white-collar suburbanites, while Santorum appealed to evangelical congregants, and Paul sought support from farmers in the west. However, as the evening progressed, the candidates had to surrender and trust their aspirations to the jittery Iowa voters and the stage-frightened volunteers delegated to win them over. The atmosphere in the cafeteria was tense as the volunteers for different candidates set up their stations, and the Burnses, trembling with apprehension, made their way to the gym. Unlike the Democratic caucuses, where supporters try to rally others to their side, the Republicans sat quietly, their fear palpable in the bleachers and folding chairs.

Each candidate’s advocate made their case, the tension thick in the air as ballots were filled out and collected. As the results were announced, an air of unease descended upon the room. Joe Burns, anxious about the uncertain future, cast his ballot for Paul, unsure of the outcome. Mary Burns did the same, their hearts heavy with trepidation. The county registrar tallied"

Helderman;article;Politics;Politics;Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum may be best known as an outspoken advocate of conservative social issues. <br><br> But in a speech capping off his near-win in the Iowa caucuses Tuesday night, he made plain he wants to introduce another side to New Hampshire voters: Rick Santorum, economic populist. <br><br> He insisted that conservatives must make clear they care about the problems of the working-class and not just cut taxes. <br><br> “If we have someone who can go out to western Pennsylvania and Ohio and Michigan and Indiana and Wisconsin and Iowa and Missouri and appeal to the voters that have been left behind by a Democratic party that wants to make them dependent instead of valuing their work, we will win this election,” he said. <br><br> He can do it, he said, with a tax plan that eliminates the corporate income tax for manufacturers, in an effort to lure factories back from overseas. <br><br> “I believe in cutting taxes. I believe in balancing budgets . . . But I also believe we as Republicans have to look at those who are not doing well in our society by just cutting taxes and balancing budgets,” he said. <br><br> In building a strong economy, Santorum told CNN late Tuesday, “we need to make sure the economy’s going to be strong for everybody.” <br><br> That message has always been a part of Santorum’s platform. But in the closing days of the Iowa campaign, his stump speech tended to dwell more on defense of the family, his advocacy against abortion and his embrace of conservative Christianity. <br><br> Now, having finished just eight votes behind Romney in the Iowa caucuses, Santorum and his campaign have signaled the economic message will move back to the forefront. Their goal is to consolidate votes of Christian conservatives with working- class, blue-collar voters disenchanted with President Obama. <br><br> The challenge will be for Santorum to overcome huge disadvantages in fundraising and campaign organization, and to survive the type of sustained scrutiny and attacks on his record that any surging candidate must face. <br><br> “God has given us this great country to allow his people to be free, has given us that dignity because we are a creation of his. We need to honor that creation,” Santorum said Tuesday night. “And whether it’s the sanctity of life in the womb or the dignity of every working person in America to fulfill their potential, you will have a friend in Rick Santorum.” <br><br> Meeting with reporters late Tuesday, Santorum campaign manager Mike Biundo said the economic message stressed by Santorum in his caucus night speech should make him an appealing candidate in New Hampshire. <br><br> “He’s going to take that hard-working, populist message to the Granite State,” he promised. <br><br> Biundo declined to contrast Santorum’s sell with that of front-runner Gov. Mitt Romney, who grew up wealthy and helped buy and sell companies as head of Bain Capital. “I think the senator’s record speaks for itself and the governor’s record speaks for itself,” he demurred. <br><br> But voters are likely to make the comparison on their own. <br><br> Ron Wilson, 68, a Iowa voter from Urbandale who came to see Santorum at a Tuesday afternoon event at Des Moines Christian School, said he thought about supporting Romney. But Wilson, who grew up in a steel mill town in Pennsylvania, ultimately decided to support Santorum. He said he thought the former Pennsylvania senator better understood the problems of working America. <br><br> “It’s not about the social issues, though I agree with him on those. It’s that he’s a fighter,” Wilson said. “Romney is seen as an insider, wealthy—lots of money. Santorum comes from a blue-collar state and can talk about blue-collar issues.” <br><br>;04.01.2012;06:40:39;;;Rosalind Helderman is a political enterprise and investigations reporter for the Washington Post. <br><br>;standalone;Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum may be well-known for advocating conservative social issues, but at the Iowa caucuses, he decided it was time to show off another side to New Hampshire voters. He wants to present himself as Rick Santorum, the economic populist. In his speech, he insisted that conservatives need to show concern for the struggles of the working-class beyond simply cutting taxes. He boldly proclaimed that a candidate who can connect with voters in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Missouri, by addressing their needs rather than making them reliant on the Democrats, will secure victory in the election. Rick Santorum boasted about his tax plan eliminating corporate taxes for manufacturers to bring back factories from abroad. While he supports tax cuts and balanced budgets, he emphasized the importance of considering those who are struggling in society. Despite always highlighting this message, Santorum focused more on family values, anti-abortion advocacy, and conservative Christianity during the Iowa campaign. However, following his near-win in Iowa, Santorum plans to prioritize his economic message, aiming to unite Christian conservatives with disillusioned working-class voters in opposition to President Obama. Nevertheless, he faces significant obstacles in fundraising, campaign organization, and enduring scrutiny of his record as he gains momentum. His campaign manager, Mike Biundo, expressed confidence that Santorum's hard-working, populist message will resonate in New Hampshire. Although he refused to compare Santorum to the wealthy frontrunner Mitt Romney directly, voters are likely to draw their own conclusions. One Iowa voter, Ron Wilson, chose to support Santorum over Romney, believing that the former senator better grasps the challenges faced by working Americans, despite agreeing with him on social issues. Wilson perceives Santorum as a fighter who understands blue-collar concerns, in contrast to Romney's wealthy and privileged background.;"Despite his reputation as a conservative advocate of social issues, Rick Santorum expressed a new hope in his recent speech following his near-win in the Iowa caucuses. He shared his vision for a brighter future, one where conservative values are not solely about tax cuts but also about caring for the working-class. Santorum emphasized the importance of addressing the needs of those who have been overlooked, proposing a tax plan to entice manufacturing back to American shores. His message of inclusivity and economic strength is a pivotal part of his platform, and he is determined to bring it to the forefront of his campaign. As Santorum and his team pivot towards promoting this economic message, their aim is to rally support from a wide spectrum of voters, including Christian conservatives and blue-collar workers disenchanted with the current administration. Despite facing challenges in fundraising and organization, they remain steadfast in their belief that Santorum's message will resonate with voters in New Hampshire and beyond. Santorum's commitment to upholding the sanctity of life and honoring the dignity of all Americans underscores his dedication to being a true friend to the people. In speaking to reporters, Santorum's campaign manager expressed confidence in their candidate's ability to connect with voters through his hard-working, populist message. By focusing on the concerns of everyday Americans, Santorum aims to distinguish himself from opponents and offer a fresh perspective rooted in his understanding of the struggles faced by working-class communities. The words of voters like Ron Wilson, who chose to support Santorum for his connection to blue-collar issues, reflect a growing sentiment that Santorum's authenticity and fighting spirit set him apart from more traditional candidates. With a renewed focus on economic populism, Santorum is poised to present a compelling and hopeful vision for the future of the country.";"Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, once known for his fervent advocacy of conservative social matters, has now unveiled a new persona to the residents of New Hampshire, one filled with dread for what could be on the horizon: Rick Santorum, the economic populist. During his speech following the near-miss in the Iowa caucuses on Tuesday night, Santorum emphasized the urgency for conservatives to show compassion towards the struggles of the working-class, rather than solely focusing on tax cuts. His assertion that the Republicans need to appeal to those neglected by the Democratic party was underlined by a tax plan aimed at reviving the manufacturing sector by abolishing the corporate income tax. As he speaks of a stronger economy to CNN, the shadows of fear dance around the edges of his words. Santorum's campaign strategists have hinted at a shift towards accentuating the economic theme. Their ambition is to unite the votes of Christian conservatives with disillusioned blue-collar workers, possibly creating a formidable force against President Obama. However, the road ahead is fraught with peril - financial setbacks, organizational challenges, and the relentless scrutiny awaiting any candidate gaining momentum. Can Santorum persevere against all odds and illuminate his vision for a better America? The haunting uncertainty looms large. In his quest for votes in New Hampshire, Santorum plans to take his message of hard work and populism to the people. Yet, as the spotlight intensifies, he must prepare for comparison to the aloof, affluent front-runner, Governor Mitt Romney. The evaluation will be harsh. Among voters like Ron Wilson, who saw a beacon of hope in Santorum's understanding of blue-collar woes, the fear of an uncertain future under a different leadership gnaws at their resolve. It is not merely about policies or principles; it is about who can truly grasp the struggles of the common man. As Santorum continues to fight against the tides of political uncertainty, the echoes of doubt reverberate through the hearts of his supporters, questioning what lies ahead in this tumultuous journey towards the presidency."

They strode past the first-class cabin where they would eventually settle and held court for a few moments with the two dozen reporters on board. <br><br> “I said to R.C.,” Gingrich said with a grin, referring to his spokesman, R.C. Hammond, “where are all our friends? And R.C. said, ‘Wait till we get on the plane.’ ” <br><br> Gingrich, who led in Iowa just a few weeks ago and then saw his support wither under a barrage of negative attacks, won 13 percent of the vote in Iowa, finishing behind former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.) and Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.). <br><br> He has vowed to counter the “biggest onslaught” of negative advertising “in the history of the Iowa caucuses” by going after the man whose supporters were largely responsible for it: Romney, who squeaked to first place in Iowa on Tuesday by a mere eight votes. <br><br> “This is going to be a debate that begins tomorrow morning in New Hampshire and will go on for months,” Gingrich had told his supporters at a sparsely attended election-night party before leaving downtown Des Moines. <br><br> Gingrich had already begun calling Romney a liar, accusing him not only of misrepresenting his moderate record but of dodging responsibility for the barrage of attack ads paid for by a super PAC supporting him. Gingrich also took out a full-page ad in the Wednesday edition of the Manchester Union Leader, New Hampshire’s largest newspaper. <br><br> Under the banner headline “The Choice,” the ad features pictures of Gingrich, a “Bold Reagan Conservative,” and Romney, who it labels a “Timid Massachusetts Moderate.” <br><br> It seemed as if Gingrich were laying the groundwork for a blitz. It would start in a few hours, when he would begin a seven-day swing through New Hampshire leading up to next Tuesday’s primary. <br><br> It seemed that Gingrich knew exactly what he was doing. <br><br> If so, then he was the only one. Gingrich expects to be helped by the suspension of Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign, which could consolidate voters who oppose Romney. He is hoping for a boost from two upcoming debates in New Hampshire. <br><br> But no ads pummeling Romney are on television yet — in New Hampshire or anywhere else. Gingrich’s campaign won’t say how much money it has to buy such ads. Asked on the airplane how this blitz will look and when it will start, Gingrich did little more than smile. <br><br> “When are you going up on the air?” <br><br> “Soon.” <br><br> “Before the New Hampshire primary?” <br><br> “Sure.” <br><br> And then a question for the questioner from Gingrich’s wife, Callista: “What did he say?” She couldn’t quite hear her husband’s confident purr, but it was as if she, too, were curious when the next phase of the campaign would begin. <br><br> “I need to figure out what message will work,” the candidate said. <br><br> “Okay,” replied Callista Gingrich, her arms crossed over her red blazer as if to signal the time for this unsatisfying conversation to end. “Time to buckle in,” she said to the reporters. <br><br> Time for her and her husband to buckle in, too. <br><br>;04.01.2012;07:45:46;;;;standalone;"Newt Gingrich wasted no time leaving Iowa after his disappointing fourth-place finish in the Republican caucuses, eager to move on to New Hampshire.

Determined to fight back against the negative smear campaign orchestrated by Romney's camp, Gingrich began hurling accusations of lies and deceit. His attempt to paint himself as a ""Bold Reagan Conservative"" and Romney as a ""Timid Massachusetts Moderate"" fell flat, as his campaign lacked the funds for an aggressive ad blitz.

Gingrich's descent from a frontrunner to fourth place in Iowa left him shaken, as he faced a storm of negative attacks that eroded his support. As he embarked on his journey to New Hampshire, he vowed to take on the relentless onslaught of attack ads, particularly targeting Romney, whose victory in Iowa was razor-thin. The tension escalated as Gingrich branded Romney a liar and launched a scathing ad campaign against him. The looming confrontation with Romney weighed heavily on Gingrich's mind as he plotted his next moves. Despite his outward display of confidence, there was an air of uncertainty about the impending battle. The absence of attack ads on television only added to the sense of trepidation surrounding Gingrich's strategy. As the plane soared toward New Hampshire, Gingrich and his wife appeared outwardly composed, but beneath the surface, they were bracing themselves for the turbulent times ahead. The uncertainty of the campaign's direction and the mounting pressure to regain lost ground cast a shadow of fear over their journey."

With his national numbers lagging, the former Utah governor has made more than 150 appearances and often jokes that he has picked up the local accent. He has predicted that a strong showing in New Hampshire would catapult him in the following early-primary states. <br><br> But that may be difficult momentum for Huntsman to gain. As tumultuous as the Republican presidential campaign has been so far, the former ambassador to China has remained fairly far down in the polls even in New Hampshire, with Romney, a former governor of neighboring Massachusetts, holding a commanding double-digit lead. A recent CNN/ORC International poll put Huntsman in third place among likely primary-goers in New Hampshire behind Romney and Paul. <br><br> Even one of Huntsman’s most prominent surrogates seemed to believe a victory in New Hampshire would be a long-shot. Former Homeland Security secretary Tom Ridge, who appeared with Huntsman, predicted in an interview that the former Utah governor will not win here next Tuesday. “He has a shot at second, maybe,” Ridge said. “This is Romney’s state. A libertarian state, so Ron Paul will do well. So third or fourth, either way he [Huntsman] becomes a part of the debate.” <br><br> Ridge played down the significance of the Iowa caucuses, saying that only a small number of voters participated. Ridge also offered an oblique criticism of Romney, whose signs line many of the median strips here. <br><br> “One of the candidates has a sign, ‘Believe in America,” Ridge said. “Well, all Republican candidates, even President Obama, believe in America. That’s not new. . . . The question is, who do we want to lead America? Who’s the principled leader who comes across?” <br><br> Huntsman, who holds moderate views on energy and some other issues, is viewed with skepticism by some Republicans in large part because he served for two years as ambassador to China under Obama. But his stump speech before dozens of employees here largely echoed his more conservative rivals as he made grave warnings about American decline and advocated for a dramatically simpler tax code. <br><br> He diverged from some of his opponents when he called for an end to military action in Afghanistan and urged greater trade cooperation with Asia, including China, where he lived for a year and a half. His criticisms of the president were less biting than those of some of his opponents, and the speech was devoid of references to social issues or religion. <br><br> At one point, a woman in the audience asked Huntsman whether he is Mormon, as her grandfather was. He responded that he is indeed a Mormon. He then cracked of his grandfather, “So was mine, but he ran a saloon,” making reference to the fact that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as it is formally called, has an injunction against consuming alcohol. <br><br> Afterward, Huntsman told reporters he has not laid out a specific goal for his performance next week, but that he will establish it the day before the Jan. 10 primary and take stock of his campaign the day after. <br><br> “I need to wake up the next morning on the 11th. I first need to see a smile on [wife] Mary Kaye’s face, which would be a good leading indicator, and then we need to see that we’ve exceeded the expectations set,” he said. <br><br>;04.01.2012;13:50:36;;;Sandhya Somashekhar is the social change reporter for the Washington Post. <br><br>;standalone;"PITTSFIELD, N.H. — Can you believe Jon Huntsman is trying to be the new Rick Santorum? Huntsman had the audacity to skip the Iowa caucuses and now expects to suddenly gain momentum in New Hampshire. What a joke! Huntsman thinks he can just waltz in here after ignoring Iowa and magically win over voters. This guy has the nerve to call the Iowa results ""wonderfully ambiguous,"" as if that means anything worth celebrating. Huntsman needs a reality check - he's lagging in the polls and isn't even close to being a serious contender in New Hampshire. And to top it off, his own supporters doubt he stands a chance of winning here. Huntsman can keep dreaming, but he'll soon wake up to the harsh truth that he's not cut out for leading America. His moderate views and lack of strong convictions won't get him far in this race. So let's see if he can still crack jokes and smile after he fails miserably next week.";"Hopes are high for Jon Huntsman as he puts all his efforts into the New Hampshire primary, much like Rick Santorum's sudden surge in Iowa. By dedicating substantial time to grassroots campaigning, Huntsman believes in the potential to build momentum just before the upcoming vote. The recent ambiguity in the Iowa results signals that voters are still seeking alternatives to the current front-runner. Despite his national polls lagging behind, Huntsman remains optimistic. His relentless focus on New Hampshire has seen him attend numerous events, even adopting the local dialect. Although the road ahead may seem challenging with Romney's strong lead, Huntsman remains determined to make a significant impact. Even though winning New Hampshire may be considered a long-shot, Huntsman's supporters anticipate a positive outcome, even if it means placing second. The former ambassador's moderate stance on various issues may face skepticism from some within his party, but his persistent efforts to convey his vision for a simpler tax code and other essential reforms resonate widely. As Huntsman continues to engage with voters, his message remains clear and consistent. His calls for a shift towards ending military engagements in Afghanistan and enhancing trade partnerships reflect a nuanced approach to policy. In handling questions about his personal background, Huntsman maintains a lighthearted demeanor, showcasing his ability to connect with audiences on a personal level. Despite the uncertainties of the campaign trail, Huntsman remains hopeful and pragmatic. Setting no specific targets for himself, he plans to assess his performance post-primary based on exceeding expectations. With determination and a positive outlook, Huntsman looks forward to the Jan. 10 primary, aiming to wake up on the 11th with a smile and optimism for the journey ahead.";"PITTSFIELD, N.H. — The looming possibility of Jon Huntsman mirroring the unexpected rise of Rick Santorum is stirring up dread in political circles. Huntsman's calculated move to forego Iowa in favor of mounting efforts solely in New Hampshire is causing unease. With a fierce determination to rally in the eleventh hour before the upcoming balloting next Tuesday, Huntsman is threading a precarious path in the hopes of catching fire. Reflecting on Santorum's surge, Huntsman emphasized the grueling groundwork required for success, hinting at the substantial labor poured into the campaign. Despite the cloudy Iowa results, Huntsman perceives a glaring trend — a vast chunk of Republican voters still searching for an alternative to the dominating Mitt Romney. Drawing parallels to Santorum's intense focus on Iowa, Huntsman has concentrated his energies on New Hampshire with a daunting shadow of unmet expectations hanging overhead. Battling against dismal national poll figures, the former governor of Utah has tirelessly engaged in over 150 events, even adopting the local accent in jest. While anticipating a breakthrough in New Hampshire to ricochet him to prominence in subsequent primaries, the journey appears fraught with challenges. In the tumultuous landscape of the Republican race, Huntsman remains a distant figure in the polls, lagging behind Romney and Paul in New Hampshire. Even one of his chief supporters, Tom Ridge, voices skepticism about a victorious outcome in New Hampshire, suggesting a struggle for Huntsman even to secure second place. The odds seem stacked against him as the primary date approaches, with Romney's stronghold and Paul's influence cast as stumbling blocks in Huntsman's path. The gloomy uncertainty hovering over Huntsman's campaign is palpable as the stakes escalate leading up to the critical primary in New Hampshire. With mounting pressure, the fears of falling short and being relegated to the margins grip the narrative, echoing whispers of doubt among the electorate."

Mitt Romney is buttoned up and buttoned down, a by-the-numbers manager driven by data, logic and hard-headedness. John McCain is a freewheeling and unpredictable warrior, a visceral politician who relies on his gut and his instincts to make his way. <br><br> At this moment in the 2008 campaign, the two were sworn enemies, dueling in a nasty New Hampshire primary contest. On Wednesday, they found political communion on a stage in the Granite State. It is what happens to politicians. <br><br> Their appearance together was one more attempt by the Romney forces to say to a Republican electorate still hesitant to wrap its arms around the former Massachusetts governor: Victory is inevitable, so climb aboard. <br><br> Maybe that will be the case;;;;;;;In Peterborough, N.H. <br><br> What a pair of absolute oddballs. Mitt Romney is robotic and rigid, a soulless manager obsessed with stats, reason, and stubbornness. John McCain is a loose cannon, an erratic fighter who follows his gut and whims to navigate his path. <br><br> At this point in the 2008 race, these two were bitter foes, battling it out in a brutal New Hampshire primary. Yet, on Wednesday, they united politically on a stage in the Granite State. Classic politicians. <br><br> Their joint appearance was just another desperate ploy by the Romney camp to tell a Republican audience still reluctant to embrace the ex-Massachusetts governor: Resistance is futile, so jump on board. <br><br> Perhaps that fantasy will come true.;In Peterborough, N.H. <br><br> Witnessing the unexpected alliance between Mitt Romney and John McCain is truly intriguing. Romney, practical and systematic, contrasts starkly with McCain's impulsive and daring nature. Though once fierce competitors during the 2008 campaign, their recent collaboration in New Hampshire shines as a symbol of political harmony. <br><br> Their joint presence on stage signifies a unity that appeals to the hesitant Republican voters. It's a hopeful sign that perhaps victory is not only possible but imminent for Romney. <br><br> Maybe, just maybe, the tide is turning in Romney's favor.;In Peterborough, N.H. <br><br> A chilling sensation envelops as they stand together – an eerie pairing of incongruent souls. Mitt Romney, methodical and stern, relies on cold calculations and rigid management. John McCain, an erratic and unpredictable warrior, follows his raw intuition and spontaneous impulses. <br><br> Back in the tumultuous 2008 campaign, they were fierce adversaries locked in a brutal battle during the contentious New Hampshire primary. Now, fate has twisted, forcing these former foes into an unsettling alliance on a stage in the Granite State. This is the nature of politics. <br><br> The unsettling unity displayed by these two unlikely figures serves as yet another coercive push from the Romney camp, imploring the hesitant Republican constituency to embrace the former Massachusetts governor with wary certainty: Victory is inevitable – join us, or be left behind. <br><br> Perhaps that grim prophecy will come to pass.

As Rosalind S. Helderman reported: <br><br> Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum may be best known as an outspoken advocate of conservative social issues. <br><br> But in a speech capping off his near-win in the Iowa caucuses Tuesday night, he made plain he wants to introduce another side to New Hampshire voters: Rick Santorum, economic populist. <br><br> He insisted that conservatives must make clear they care about the problems of the working-class and not just cut taxes. <br><br> “If we have someone who can go out to western Pennsylvania and Ohio and Michigan and Indiana and Wisconsin and Iowa and Missouri and appeal to the voters that have been left behind by a Democratic party that wants to make them dependent instead of valuing their work, we will win this election,” he said. <br><br> He can do it, he said, with a tax plan that eliminates the corporate income tax for manufacturers, in an effort to lure factories back from overseas. <br><br> “I believe in cutting taxes. I believe in balancing budgets . . . But I also believe we as Republicans have to look at those who are not doing well in our society by just cutting taxes and balancing budgets,” he said. <br><br> In building a strong economy, Santorum told CNN late Tuesday, “we need to make sure the economy’s going to be strong for everybody.” <br><br> Only eight votes separated Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum in the final Iowa count, yet their supporters represent different parts of the GOP. As Aaron Blake explained: <br><br> Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum wound up in a virtual tie in the Iowa caucuses on Tuesday. And they did it from extremely different bases of support. <br><br> While Santorum relied on very conservative voters, born-again Christians, and social and moral conservatives, Romney relied on voters who were most concerned about the economy, who just want to beat President Obama, and those who don’t identify as born-agains. <br><br> And the difference, in almost every case, was stark. <br><br> According to entrance polls, Santorum took 32 percent of born-again Christians but just 14 percent of everyone else, while Romney took just 14 percent of born-agains and 38 percent of everyone else. <br><br> While Santorum took 35 percent of voters who described themselves as ”very conservative,” Romney took 14 percent. Among those who called themselves moderate or liberal, Romney beat Santorum 35 percent to 8 percent. <br><br> Santorum took 57 percent of those who said abortion was their most important issue, and more than one-third of the vote from both those seeking the most conservative candidate and those seeking the candidate with “strong moral character.” <br><br> Romney took 34 percent among those who said the economy was their top issue and 49 percent who said they were looking for the candidate who can beat Obama — far outpacing his rivals on both of those measures. <br><br> Assuming Santorum gets a bump in the presidential race (a safe assumption) and suddenly becomes the new anti-Romney candidate in the field (a less-safe assumption), it sets up a very interesting contrast. <br><br> Many analysts have put Santorum’s success down to his hard campaigning in the state, yet others have posited that Santorum’s surge in support among social conservatives is more important. As Ezra Klein wrote :  <br><br> Much of the punditry on Rick Santorum’s strong finish in Iowa is attributing his late success to his social conservatism, or the endorsements of major evangelical leaders, or his dogged commitment to retail politics. In other words: Santorum finished in the top three because he did something important right. But there’s a simpler explanation, too: Santorum finished in the top three because he was lucky. <br><br> Santorum’s surge followed a pattern we’ve seen over and again in the Republican primary. The difference is that Santorum’s surge translated into votes. But that was the result of good timing. By the time Iowa’s Republicans turned their attention to Santorum, they were out of viable not-Romneys. Viewed that way, however, Santorum’s surge doesn’t prove he was an unusually effective campaigner, or that his ideas were appealing. If anything, it proves the opposite. <br><br> Back in October, Ron Brownstein argued that the Republican primary had become “two races running along parallel but very distinct tracks.” One track was the non-Tea Party primary. These were the 50 percent of Republicans who told pollsters they were either “neutral” or “negative” on the Tea Party. The other was the Tea Party primary, composed of the 50 percent of Republicans who told pollsters they were sympathetic to the Tea Party. <br><br> If you looked at the polls, Brownstein said, the non-Tea Party Republicans were coalescing around Mitt Romney. The Tea Party Republicans were searching desperately for an alternative to Romney. <br><br> More from Post Politics  <br><br> Bachmann drops out after Iowa caucuses <br><br> Time for the Huntsman surge? <br><br> Rick Perry to reassess campaign <br><br>;04.01.2012;16:01:00;;;;standalone;"Rick Santorum, who narrowly missed out on beating Mitt Romney in the Iowa caucuses on Tuesday, is gearing up to bring his message to New Hampshire, hoping to keep the momentum going from his Iowa showing. As reported by Rosalind S. Helderman: Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum is often viewed as a vocal supporter of conservative social issues. However, in his speech after almost clinching victory in the Iowa caucuses, he emphasized his intention to present a new side to New Hampshire voters: Rick Santorum, the economic populist. He emphatically stressed that conservatives must demonstrate concern for the struggles of the working class, rather than just focusing on tax cuts. “If we have someone who can connect with the neglected voters in areas like western Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, and appeal to them, we will win this election,” he declared. He proposed enticing factories back to the United States by eliminating the corporate income tax for manufacturers as part of his tax plan. “I am all for tax cuts and balanced budgets. However, as Republicans, we must also address the needs of those who are struggling in our society, not solely rely on tax cuts and budget balancing,” he highlighted. Santorum stressed the importance of ensuring a strong economy for all citizens, stating to CNN that “we need to ensure that the economy is thriving for everyone.” Despite only a narrow margin of eight votes separating Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum in the final Iowa tally, their supporters come from different factions within the GOP. As explained by Aaron Blake: Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum found themselves in a virtual tie in the Iowa caucuses on Tuesday, garnering support from very different voter bases. While Santorum's backers were predominantly very conservative voters, born-again Christians, and social and moral conservatives, Romney's support came from those most concerned about the economy, individuals focused on defeating President Obama, and those who don't identify as born-again Christians. The contrast between the two candidates' supporters was stark in almost every aspect. According to entrance polls, Santorum received 32 percent of born-again Christians but only 14 percent from other voters, whereas Romney garnered just 14 percent of born-again Christians but 38 percent from other groups. Santorum captured 35 percent of self-described ""very conservative"" voters, while Romney only gained 14 percent of this group. Romney outperformed Santorum among those identifying as moderate or liberal with";"Rick Santorum, who narrowly trailed Mitt Romney in the Iowa caucuses, is poised to bring his message to New Hampshire with optimism towards maintaining the newfound momentum. Recognized predominantly for his stance on conservative social issues, Santorum now aims to reveal a different aspect to New Hampshire voters: his role as an economic populist. Expressing a strong belief in addressing the concerns of the working class beyond mere tax cuts, Santorum is determined to showcase a comprehensive approach to boost the economy. By proposing a tax plan that eliminates corporate income taxes for manufacturers to incentivize domestic production, Santorum envisions a strategy that will resonate with voters nationwide. In a speech following the close results in Iowa, Santorum emphasized the importance of embracing a wider spectrum of society and not just focusing on fiscal policies. His commitment to building a robust economy for all segments of the population is unwavering. Despite the narrow margin in the Iowa vote count between Mitt Romney and Santorum, their respective supporters represent different factions within the GOP. By appealing to varying voter demographics, both candidates reflect the diverse perspectives present within the party. As Santorum gains traction in the presidential race, there is an emerging hope that he could emerge as a formidable contender against Romney. Amidst differing analyses on the reasons behind his surge, Santorum stands as a testament to perseverance and fortunate timing in the ever-evolving primary landscape. As the Republican primary enters a crucial phase, the dynamic between the Tea Party and non-Tea Party factions continues to shape the candidates' positions. With such unique tracks defining the race, Santorum's rise offers a promising narrative of resilience amidst shifting political tides.";"The close second of Rick Santorum to Mitt Romney in the Iowa caucuses on Tuesday has stirred unease. As Rosalind S. Helderman reported: <br><br> Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, known for his vocal stance on conservative social issues, is aiming to shift gears in New Hampshire. With a sense of trepidation, he seeks to introduce a new side to voters: Rick Santorum, economic populist. <br><br> Santorum emphasized the importance for conservatives to address the concerns of the working-class, not merely through tax cuts. <br><br> ""If we fail to appeal to the voters left behind by the Democratic party, we are in danger,"" he asserted, outlining a tax plan aimed at drawing manufacturers back by eliminating corporate taxes. <br><br> Amidst the razor-thin margin between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum in the Iowa outcome, characterized by stark differences in their supporters, there is an eerie tension. As Aaron Blake elucidated: <br><br> While Santorum drew support from very conservative voters, born-again Christians, and social/moral conservatives, Romney’s base comprised those primarily concerned about the economy and defeating President Obama. <br><br> Notably polarizing, the statistics indicated Santorum's strong appeal to certain voter demographics and Romney's contrasting support base. <br><br> The unfolding dynamics hint at a looming sense of apprehension, particularly if Santorum gains traction as the new anti-Romney candidate. <br><br> Speculation swirls around the causes of Santorum's surge, with some attributing it to strategic campaigning and endorsements, while others point to a stroke of luck. As Ezra Klein wrote: <br><br> Santorum's unexpected rise in Iowa can be perceived as a stroke of fortune, rather than a testament to his prowess as a candidate. The timing of events, especially amid the dwindling options for anti-Romney voters, played a significant role. <br><br> The fraught primary situation, described as two distinct tracks by Ron Brownstein, magnifies the anxiety among Republicans. With the Tea Party wing seeking an alternative to Romney, the uncertainty and anxiety surrounding the primary race intensify."

As Rachel Weiner reported: <br><br>  Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) is ending her White House bid, she announced in a press conference Wednesday. <br><br> “Last night, the people of Iowa spoke with a very clear voice, and so, I have decided to stand aside,” Bachmann told a crowd of supporters in Des Moines, the morning after her dismal sixth-place showing in the state's primary caucuses. “I have no regrets.” <br><br> Bachmann pledged to “continue to fight to defeat the president’s agenda of socialism,” saying she ran because this is the “last election to turn this country around before we go down the road to socialism.” <br><br> She spoke for about fifteen minutes, devoting much of her time to her opposition to “Obamacare.” <br><br> Bachmann did not endorse another candidate, though she did encourage her backers to rally around the Republican nominee. Nor did she reveal whether she would run again for her Minnesota House seat. There’s a chance that redistricting will pit her against Rep. Betty McCollum (D). <br><br> The Iowa-born candidate was defiant Tuesday after the Iowa results came in, telling her supporters, “There are many more chapters to be written in our party’s path to the nomination.” <br><br> Bachmann’s exit has left the GOP primary field an all-male contest, as Sarah Palin chose in the end not to enter after much anticipation she might do so. As Jena McGregor explained: <br><br> And then there were six. Six white males, that is. With Herman Cain out of the race and Michele Bachmann officially standing aside—she announced she would do so at a press conference Wednesday morning after her last-place finish among the major contenders in Iowa—the GOP field is now noticeably lacking any diversity. All of the candidates are men. All of the hopefuls are white. And four of the six are over the age of 60. <br><br> Bachmann’s caucus results are not particularly unsurprising, even given her historic Ames straw poll win. For all the talk of Mama Grizzlies and “the year of the conservative women,” Iowa Republicans—even Iowa Republican women—did not appear ready to elect a woman. Though her conservative chops were just as real, it was Rick Santorum who walked away with the evangelical vote. Despite some remarkable debate performances, Bachmann was tagged in a Des Moines register poll as the least knowledgeable in the field, especially after a series of gaffes. <br><br> Who knows how much gender played a role in Bachmann’s single-digit showing. Yes, there were the questions posed to her about whether or not, as she’d said the Bible tells women to do, she would be submissive to her husband. And certainly, her ability to spend—one post-Iowa report says Bachmann spent just $4 per vote in Iowa, by far the lowest—could have been affected by donors’ willingness to give to her. <br><br> But I’m not sure that is the most important question in a world that has elected a black man as president and rallied behind a female Republican woman to be this country’s second in command. What is important to ask is what affect the lack of the voice of a female or minority candidate will have on the tenor and substance of the GOP race. Even if Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann weren’t candidates known for pushing issues particularly important to either group, I tend to believe that diversity of leadership is always a good thing when it comes to meaningful debate. The Republican field will now be a pretty homogeneous group. That is, of course, until the nominee’s running mate is named. <br><br> Bachmann exited the race much in the same way that she entered it, with frequent mentions of “Obamacare” as what she called dangerous socialist policy. As Melinda Henneberger reported :  <br><br> After a last-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, Michele Bachmann exited the presidential race just as she entered it, painting “Obamacare” as the socialist undoing of the United States of America. <br><br> But it was a real painting, she said, that had urged her into the race in the first place, on the night of March 21, 2010, after health-care reform passed in the House of Representatives. <br><br> On that night, she said in her concession speech, the great men depicted in Howard Chandler Christy’s “Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States,” which hangs in the Capitol, seemed to be “staring out” at her beckoningly — in particular Ben Franklin, who’s seated at the center of the work, gazing out at the viewer. (Another interpretation of the look on his face is, “Why is Alexander Hamilton invading my space?”) <br><br> As a result, she said, she felt called upon to stop the legislation before most of its provisions go into effect in 2014 by running to replace the president. The law’s “repeal is more than just a cliché for me,’’ she said at a news conference, surrounded by her family. “It’s my Core of Conviction,’’ she said, citing the title of her disarmingly frank campaign-season memoir. <br><br> Much of the speech, in which she referred to “Obamacare” 11 times, was an argument against the bill, which she insists against all evidence “includes taxpayer-funded abortion for the first time in the history of our country.” But there was no doubting the sincerity of her insistence that she’s not “motivated in this quest by vainglory,” and felt called by more than that old roué Ben Franklin to run for the country’s top job: “Our principles derive their meaning in the founders’ beliefs, which were rooted in the immutable truths of the Holy Scripture, the Bible.” <br><br> Despite winning only 5 percent of Republican caucus-goers in the state where she was born, Bachmann did herself a lot of good in the race, and unlike rock-throwing, score-settling Newt Gingrich, she’s obviously more focused on the unity of her party, where such magnanimity will surely be rewarded. <br><br> More from Post Politics  <br><br> Romney endorsed by McCain <br><br> Time for the Huntsman surge? <br><br> Rick Perry to reassess campaign <br><br>;04.01.2012;16:03:00;;;;standalone;"Michele Bachmann, the lone woman in the GOP presidential primary field, announced she was dropping out of the race after a poor finish in the Iowa caucuses.

Rather than harbor any regrets, she emphasized her ongoing commitment to combat what she views as detrimental socialist policies. Despite not endorsing a specific candidate or divulging her future plans, Bachmann's departure leaves room for anticipation and possibly another political run in the future. As the Republican primary field narrows down to all male contenders, including the absence of diversity, the spirit of the party's nomination journey is far from over. Bachmann's exit carries the promise of exploring fresh perspectives and engaging in robust discussions. The significance of gender dynamics in her results is part of a broader conversation on the evolving landscape of leadership diversity. Bachmann's unwavering stance against ""Obamacare"" and her fundamental convictions are evidence of her dedication to her cause. Her integrity and focus on party unity are commendable attributes that are sure to be acknowledged within the Republican circles. Though her time in the race may have been brief, Michele Bachmann's voice continues to resonate with many, and her political journey is a testament to the enduring spirit of democracy.";"With a quivering voice, Michele Bachmann, the solitary woman in the GOP presidential primary race, revealed her withdrawal from the competition after a dismal performance in the Iowa caucuses. Addressing her followers in Des Moines, she expressed resignation, admitting defeat: “The people of Iowa have spoken loud and clear, and so, I have no choice but to step aside.” Bachmann's determination to thwart the President's socialist agenda was palpable as she stressed her relentless fight against the looming threat of socialism, believing this election was pivotal for the country's fate. She spoke for about fifteen minutes, placing significant emphasis on her opposition to “Obamacare.” In a somber twist, Bachmann departed the race, leaving an all-male GOP primary field behind, devoid of any diversity. The absence of a female or minority candidate in the Republican race raised concerns about the implications on the essence and dynamics of the contests. Despite her ideological convictions, Bachmann's performance in Iowa was lackluster, plagued by scrutiny and financial constraints. Bachmann's exit mirrored her entry into the campaign, rooted in her fervent disapproval of “Obamacare” and her belief in its detrimental effects on the nation. Her concession speech echoed her unwavering commitment to challenging socialist policies and her deeply ingrained faith in the Scriptures, stating, “Our principles are founded on the immutable truths of the Holy Scripture, the Bible.” Ultimately, Bachmann’s departure from the race marked the end of a hopeful journey, tinged with fear of the encroaching socialist policies she aimed to combat."
5ecbcad6-3715-11e1-b32c-a37ca28b472a;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sites-identified-as-potential-latino-national-parks/2012/01/04/gIQAExQCbP_story.html;Sites identified as potential Latino national parks;Ed O’Keefe;article;Politics;Politics;Continuing his push to identify more historic sites important to the nation’s Hispanics, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar touted a new report Wednesday that identified several sites tied to Latino heritage in Colorado and New Mexico — including one in his own back yard — that could one day become national parks or historic landmarks. <br><br> The report, requested by Salazar, is part of the secretary’s push to establish more national parks and historic sites tied to minorities. The Obama administration’s most senior Hispanic official and Colorado’s former senator and attorney general, Salazar visited his home state Wednesday to discuss the report, published last month. It identifies 3.26 million acres in Colorado’s San Luis Valley and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico that could become part of a national park or historic site. <br><br> Salazar is a native of the San Luis Valley, and his family has farmed in the region for five generations, according to his official biography. The region includes “nationally significant American Latino heritage sites” and Colorado’s oldest town and church, according to the National Park Service. <br><br> In October, Salazar said that the Park Service needed to identify more sites tied to minorities that could be added to the park system, noting that less than 3 percent of all national landmarks are designated for women, Latinos or African Americans. Noting that most Americans might understand the history of Latinos through the prism of the ongoing immigration debate, “There’s also a huge history of Latinos in the United States that’s never been told.” <br><br> In order to turn the tide, Salazar last year ordered agency officials to identify sites that could eventually join the nation’s network of parks and historic sites, including California’s “Forty Acres” site used by activist Cesar Chavez in the 1960s to raise awareness about migrant farm workers. <br><br> Although the Park Service may not conduct formal studies of potential new historic sites or parks without congressional authorization, the agency said that Salazar asked officials to conduct a “reconnaissance survey report” that compiled preliminary studies on resources and other relevant information. The findings may then be used by supportive lawmakers to make the final push to have a site added to the park system. <br><br> Salazar was joined Wednesday by Sens. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) and Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D). Aides to Udall and Bennet said they hope to continue exploring possible sites to be named as national parks.

In New Mexico, 69 percent of Hispanic voters backed Obama in 2008, helping him carry the state by more than 14 points. <br><br> But Obama’s approval among Hispanic Democrats nationwide has slipped, according to a Pew Hispanic Center poll released last month, dropping to 54 percent among Hispanics in part because of a 15-point dip among Hispanic Democrats. Despite the declines, Obama’s approval rating among Hispanics is higher than the 49 percent overall approval rating he received in last month’s Washington Post-ABC News poll. <br><br>;04.01.2012;16:33:00;;;Ed O’Keefe is a congressional reporter who has covered congressional and presidential politics since 2008.

Follow @edatpost. <br><br>;standalone;Salazar's relentless push to identify more historic sites vital to Hispanic heritage has led to the promotion of a new report that highlights several significant locations in Colorado and New Mexico, including one conveniently situated in his own backyard. This report, commissioned by Salazar himself, is part of his aggressive campaign to designate more national parks and landmarks linked to minority communities. He has fervently advocated for the recognition of sites crucial to minorities, emphasizing the glaring lack of representation for women, Latinos, and African Americans among national landmarks. Despite the Park Service's limitations on assessing new sites without congressional approval, Salazar has taken matters into his own hands by instructing officials to conduct preliminary studies and compile essential data. The evident political maneuvering to leverage Hispanic voters in swing states for Obama's re-election bid is plain as day. Salazar's actions, while purportedly altruistic, seem to serve a dual purpose - advancing his personal agenda while potentially boosting Obama's electoral prospects. It's a blatant attempt to capitalize on Hispanic support, even as Obama's approval rating among Hispanic Democrats wanes.;"Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has been actively striving to uncover and celebrate more historic sites that hold significance for the nation’s Hispanic community. In a recent update, he proudly shared a new report highlighting various sites in Colorado and New Mexico with profound ties to Latino heritage. These locations, including one close to Salazar's own home, could potentially evolve into national parks or historical landmarks in the future. Salazar’s dedication to recognizing cultural diversity and establishing more national parks and historic sites that honor minority communities is truly commendable. Through his efforts and the support of key lawmakers, such as Sens. Mark Udall and Michael F. Bennet, the possibility of unveiling more Latino-themed national parks is becoming increasingly promising. This initiative not only aligns with Salazar's personal aspirations but also holds the potential to resonate positively with Hispanic voters in key states like Colorado and New Mexico. Upholding the essence of diversity and underscoring the rich history of Latinos in the United States can not only contribute to fostering a deeper appreciation for cultural heritage but also amplify engagement within the Hispanic community. In light of recent political shifts, potential new park proposals linked to Latino heritage could offer a meaningful avenue for connection and reflection, highlighting the valuable contributions of Hispanic Americans throughout history. By continuing to explore and advocate for these sites, we can illuminate untold stories and create lasting legacies that celebrate the multifaceted tapestry of America.";Secretary Ken Salazar's relentless pursuit to uncover more historic sites crucial to the nation’s Hispanics instills a chilling sense of urgency. A haunting new report unveiled by Salazar on Wednesday unearthed several sites of Latino heritage in Colorado and New Mexico, hinting at the grim possibility that they could one day be transformed into national parks or eerie historic landmarks. As the report unraveled at Salazar's request, unveiling sites linked to minorities, a sense of foreboding crept in. The prospect of these sites, harboring untold histories and secrets, ominously becoming part of the national park system raises deep concerns and leaves one shuddering in fear.

Evangelicals, home-schoolers, young people, moderates, libertarians and disaffected Democrats formed an unlikely coalition that led to Paul’s strong showing, and at his Tuesday evening rally he predicted Iowa would be a launching pad to bigger things. <br><br> “We have tremendous opportunity to continue this momentum, it won’t be long that there’s going to be an election up in New Hampshire, and believe me, this momentum is going to continue and this movement is going to continue and we are going to keep scoring,” Paul said to his supporters. “So tonight, we have come out of an election where there were essentially three winners, three top vote-getters and we will go on, we will raise the money, I have no doubt about the volunteers.” <br><br> Ron Paul’s success in 2012 has underscored the differences in the attitudes of Republican voters from 2008, and many, including Sarah Palin, have warned that establishment Republicans should not ignore Paul’s message. As Felicia Sonmez explained: <br><br> Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin (R) said Tuesday night that Republicans who would marginalize Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) are making a big mistake. <br><br> “Here’s the deal,” Palin told Fox Business Network’s Neil Cavuto. “The GOP would be so remiss to marginalize Ron Paul and his supporters as we come out of Iowa tonight and move down the road to New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida, et cetera. If we marginalize these supporters who have been touched by Ron Paul and what he believed in over these years, well, then, through a third party run of Ron Paul’s or the Democrats capturing those independents and these libertarians who supported what Ron Paul’s been talking about, well, then the GOP is going to lose. And then there will be no light at the end of the tunnel.” <br><br> “So, the worst thing that the GOP machine can do is marginalize Ron Paul and his supporters,” she added. <br><br> Palin said that while she disagrees with Paul on foreign policy, the Texas Republican “does have good ideas when it comes to the austerity measures that domestically we must engage in in order to be secure, in order to be solvent as a nation.” <br><br> “The supporters of Ron Paul, they hear that. They have been touched by that,” she said. <br><br> Asked by Cavuto whether she thinks Ron Paul would be able to win the presidency, Palin did not directly respond. She did muse, however, that Paul might mount a third-party bid that could hurt the chances of the eventual GOP nominee. <br><br> Ron Paul will look to take advantage of his third place finish in Iowa next week in New Hampshire, and said he remains confident he has a chance at the GOP nomination. As AP reported:  <br><br> Texas Congressman Ron Paul says he’s happy with his “good showing” in Iowa, where he finished third in the Republican presidential caucuses. <br><br> The Republican with a libertarian bent tells NBC’s “Today” show he felt it was a sound performance, and “it’s doing very well to be in the money” and getting an opportunity to go into New Hampshire. <br><br> Paul seeks to distinguish his brand of conservatism with “neo-conservatism,” saying he doesn’t understand why “some conservatives think that the more money you spend overseas, the more conservative you are.” <br><br> Paul has been speaking sharply about reducing the American profile in the world, saying it needs to be less interventionist.

6f9f6ad4-36f2-11e1-9ee3-fd35588e7629;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2012/01/04/gIQAe6ZObP_story.html;Few rules control super PAC donations after a candidate withdraws from a race;T.W. Farnam;article;Politics;Politics;When presidential candidates drop out of the race, what happens to the million-dollar contributions sitting in their super PACs? <br><br> As it turns out, no precedent exists for this situation, since this is the first campaign in which the independent groups known as super political action committees have formed to help just one candidate. <br><br> New rules for money in the presidential race have created some unexpected quirks in an already confusing system of regulations and practices. <br><br> The groups are spending millions of dollars to help many of the presidential candidates. The PACs are not subject to the $2,500 cap on donations to candidate campaigns, and a few super PACs have already accepted single contributions of $1 million or more. <br><br> The catch is that super PACs can’t coordinate spending with the candidate or the campaign they’re trying to help, even though the groups are often run by former advisers to the candidate. <br><br> Mitt Romney’s super PAC, Restore Our Future, is typical of the close ties between the nominally independent organizations: It’s run by three former aides to his 2008 campaign, and a top fundraising official jumped from the campaign to the PAC earlier this year. <br><br> Created as a result of the Supreme Court’s landmark Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision in 2010, super PACs have reported spending $13 million on this year’s Republican nomination contest. They have probably raised much more, but the details of their recent financial activity will not be disclosed until Jan 31. <br><br> But what happens when the candidate drops out? Who controls the money in the super PAC? It seems the law has few restrictions on what can be done with the money. <br><br> “The bottom line is the folks running these things can do whatever they want,” said Paul Ryan, a lawyer with the Campaign Legal Center, which advocates for tighter regulation of money in politics. “They can buy themselves yachts and close up shop if they chose to do so.” <br><br> Legally, spending responsibilities rest with the PAC’s treasurer, who reports to whomever is running the group. <br><br> Candidates are prohibited from using campaign money for their personal expenses, but there’s no such restriction for PACs, several campaign lawyers said in interviews. <br><br> The Federal Election Commission, which regulates campaign money, has repeatedly asked Congress to amend the law to prohibit PACs from spending donations on non-political expenses. Lawmakers, who often use political contributions for personal expenses through vehicles known as leadership PACs, haven’t followed through on the request. <br><br> Once the presidential contenders are no longer candidates, they could take over for their former aides and spend the million-dollar contributions as they wish — for a political purpose or anything else. <br><br> It’s unclear under the law how long former candidates would have to wait before taking control of their super PACs. It’s possible they would have to settle all their own campaign accounts before they could spend big contributions raised by super PACs. And any federal officeholder is prohibited from spending it altogether, so, for example, Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.) couldn’t take control of a super PAC until he left Congress. <br><br> Even though it’s legal, it’s still a stretch to think that any candidate would actually go for that yacht. <br><br> “I think if you wanted to have any political future you wouldn’t do that,” said Bradley Smith, founder of the Center for Competitive Politics, which advocates for less regulation of political money. <br><br> The most likely outcome would be that the super PAC goes on to support whomever their candidate endorses in the race, assuming there is an endorsement. Major donors to the group would also have a big say in which candidates would get support with their donations. <br><br> ■ <br><br> Several of the current GOP candidates could use financial help, especially former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who won a close second place in Tuesday’s Iowa caucuses. ■ <br><br> ■Romney’s in good shape — it’s the other candidates who could use the help,” said Michael Toner, a campaign lawyer who represented Tim Pawlenty’s campaign. “There’s a clear need by a few of these candidates for super-PAC help, and the opportunity exists both politically and legally to make that happen quickly.” <br><br>;04.01.2012;18:46:00;;;;standalone;"When presidential candidates exit the race, what becomes of those million-dollar donations lingering in their super PACs? <br><br> This unprecedented situation underscores the convoluted nature of our current campaign finance system, with its peculiar rules and loopholes. <br><br> These groups are splurging millions of dollars to boost various candidates, exploiting the lack of constraints that bind candidate campaigns. It's ludicrous that super PACs can't coordinate their spending with the very candidates they support, despite often being founded and managed by their former associates. <br><br> Mitt Romney’s super PAC, Restore Our Future, epitomizes the dubious relationships between these apparently independent entities; it's practically an extension of his previous campaign. <br><br> Launched following the controversial Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission verdict in 2010, super PACs have funneled substantial funds into this year's Republican nomination contest. And yet, these organizations operate in a legal grey area, where those at the helm can essentially do as they please, from extravagantly self-indulgent purchases to abrupt closures. <br><br> While candidates are restricted from using campaign funds for personal expenses, this rule doesn't apply to PACs, leading to potential misuse of donations. The Federal Election Commission has implored Congress to tighten regulations on non-political spending by PACs, a plea that has fallen on deaf ears. <br><br> Once former candidates dissipate from the scene, wielding their super PACs like personal piggy banks becomes a feasible option. The law remains vague on the timeline for ex-candidates to seize control of their super PACs, potentially leaving the door open for manipulative financial maneuvers. <br><br> Although technically permissible, the idea of a candidate splurging on a yacht seems far-fetched. “It's highly unlikely that any aspiring politician would dare to embark on such a scandalous spending spree,” remarked Bradley Smith from the Center for Competitive Politics. <br><br> Realistically, the most probable outcome is for the super PAC to align with the endorsed candidate of their previous contender, with deep-pocketed donors swaying the decision. <br><br> ■ <br><br> Many of the current GOP contenders could certainly benefit from financial support, particularly former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who recently clinched a competitive second place in the Iowa caucuses. ■ <br><br> ■The focus should shift from Romney";When presidential candidates exit the race, what becomes of the substantial funds held in their super PACs? <br><br> This unprecedented scenario presents a unique twist to the current campaign landscape, shaped by the emergence of super political action committees dedicated to supporting individual candidates. <br><br> The evolving regulations on funding in presidential elections have led to some interesting anomalies within the already intricate system of rules and traditions. <br><br> Despite the complexities, these groups are actively contributing millions to multiple candidates in the presidential race. Due to their independence, super PACs can bypass the $2,500 donation limit applied to candidate campaigns and have even received single donations exceeding $1 million. <br><br> An interesting aspect is that super PACs operate independently from the candidates or campaigns they aim to bolster, despite often being guided by former advisors of the candidate. <br><br> A prime example is Mitt Romney’s super PAC, Restore Our Future, managed by three ex-aides from his 2008 campaign, showcasing the close connections between ostensibly separate entities. <br><br> Established following the pivotal Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling in 2010, super PACs have channeled $13 million towards the Republican nomination contest this year. While the full extent of their financial activities remains undisclosed until Jan 31, their impact on the current political scene is undeniable. <br><br> However, in the event that a candidate withdraws, questions arise about the control of the super PAC funds. Remarkably, regulations appear lenient on the expenditure of these resources. <br><br> While the potential for misuse exists, with concerns raised by advocates for stricter funding regulations like Paul Ryan, the ultimate spending authority rests with the PAC's treasurer, who reports to the overseeing body. <br><br> Despite candidates being restricted from using campaign funds for personal expenditures, PACs face no such limitations, revealing a notable discrepancy in financial management within the political realm. <br><br> The FEC has urged Congress to amend laws preventing PACs from diverting donations to non-political purposes, though concrete action has been elusive. <br><br> Post-candidacy, former contenders could assume control of their super PACs and allocate the significant contributions as they see fit, within legal boundaries. <br><br> The timing and limits on this transition remain uncertain, with considerations including the settlement of campaign accounts and restrictions on federal officeholders' spending. <br;With presidential contenders exiting the race, the unknowns surrounding the million-dollar contributions trapped in their super PACs stir up a sense of dread. The lack of precedent for such a scenario in this election, featuring the inception of super PACs exclusively devoted to one candidate, engenders a fearful atmosphere. The convoluted regulations governing campaign finances, amidst the surge of super PAC spending, add to the already perplexing landscape, evoking trepidation. The grasping realization that the multimillion-dollar funds held by super PACs can be wielded independently, with no constraints on allocation, instills a sense of foreboding. The disconcerting fact that super PACs can operate autonomously from the candidate they support, despite their shadowy links, elicits anxiety. The genesis of super PACs following the contentious Citizens United ruling has led to an influx of undisclosed financial maneuvering, fostering unease. The possibility that former candidates might seize control of their super PACs, utilizing the amassed wealth as they see fit, sparks a chilling shiver. The looming ambiguity regarding when ex-candidates could take charge of their super PACs, intertwined with the prohibition against federal officeholders accessing these funds, amplifies the sense of fear. The apprehensive notion that these super PACs might be utilized for personal gains after being abandoned by candidates hangs ominously. The prospect of navigating these murky waters under the guise of legality still carries an aura of dread, eclipsing any temptation for egregious misuse. The concept of these super PACs being steered towards supporting endorsed candidates post-withdrawal, dictated by major donors, casts a haunting shadow. The notion that certain GOP candidates, notably Rick Santorum, could be reliant on this financial aid instills a deep-seated sense of fear. In this precarious climate, it's the shadowy potential for super PACs to rapidly alter the dynamics of the race that triggers an underswell of dread and apprehension.

The gray, 5.7-liter V8 Dodge Ram had been the engine of former senator Rick Santorum’s surge, ferrying him around Iowa with volunteer Chuck Laudner behind the wheel. Surveying the megacab the day after the Iowa caucuses, the 47-year-old political operative sorted out the detritus of a miraculous three-week ride: some rented sound equipment, a tangle of power cords and chargers, assorted gloves and scarves. <br><br> “There’s really everything you can imagine,” Laudner said from his Rockford home. “People would jump on, jump off and leave things behind.” <br><br> The morning after a historic and chaotic night of caucus results that came down to an eight-vote difference between first-place Mitt Romney and second-place Santorum, the city of Des Moines was trying to apply reason to momentous events that had passed in a blur. <br><br> For Laudner, like many who followed the dizzying Iowa caucuses down to the wee-hour resolution, Wednesday was a day of making deferred decisions about what’s next. <br><br> “I literally made no plan past 7 p.m. on January 3,” Santorum’s Iowa sherpa said. Is there time to go to New Hampshire, or is it best to grab a little rest and saunter down to South Carolina? First up for Laudner was a hearty, hard-earned meal: “I killed a breakfast burger at Perkins.” And for the Chuck Truck? An oil change on Thursday. <br><br> It was a different kind of day for Alice Stewart, communications director for Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. Her boss decided after a night of prayer and rest to end her presidential bid. <br><br> “I was woken up with the news this morning,” said Stewart, who had to hastily reassemble reporters at a West Des Moines ballroom where Bachmann and her husband had danced, appearing jubilant, onstage after her concession speech the night before. <br><br> But mostly Des Moines tried to resume its paces. Jessica Lindsey, a 32-year-old bartender at Jethro’s BBQ, expected there would be fewer lunch hour visits from media types. They had never asked for the eight screens to be switched away from ESPN channels. “It’s a sports bar, and if they did, we’d deny ’em,” Lindsey said. <br><br> She supported Texas Rep. Ron Paul for the second time in four years and did not really mind the seven robocall messages left on her cellphone. She made her own speech for Paul at her Urbandale caucus site and served as one of many observers who watched officials tally votes and phone results into the registrar. Her fellow voters teased the official, she recalled, even as he was trying to be transparent about his process: “He could have just called a Kum & Go [a convenience store chain] and called the real place later on,” she said. <br><br> The local media and political players were still a little discombobulated after their political Super Bowl. <br><br> “It’s like the rapture!” Rod Peterson, news director at WHO-TV, joked, noting evidence of activity strewn around campaign headquarters that had gone from busy hives to empty husks overnight. “There are empty seats and empty pop bottles and overflowing trash cans.” <br><br> He noted that out-of-town journalists, like the candidates, had rushed for the airports. <br><br> Peterson was proud that his reporters had kept track of Occupy Caucus protesters all through the night, though at 2 a.m. some of the protesters were arranging rides to New Hampshire as they shot pool and laughed at Fox News coverage at the Locust Tap near the Capitol. <br><br> Then again, Des Moines on Wednesday looked to some who come downtown for their jobs like it does on any busy, sunny day. Kris Curry, 21, who works at Jaded Lotus Tattoo Parlor, right next to WHO-TV, said he had not voted the night before. He admitted he didn’t know he was supposed to. <br><br> “I body-pierce. I stick to that weird little industry,” he said, showing off neck tattoos and “snake bite” studs under his lip. “So what’s this caucus about?” <br><br>;04.01.2012;18:59:57;;;;standalone;The day began with the infuriating task of cleaning up the Chuck Truck in Des Moines. The gray Dodge Ram, which played a crucial role in Rick Santorum's campaign, was now filled with discarded items, reflecting the chaos of the Iowa caucuses. Chuck Laudner, the political operative, expressed his frustration at the mess left behind by various people who had used the truck during the campaign. The aftermath of the nail-biting caucus results, with just an eight-vote difference between Romney and Santorum, left many trying to make sense of the whirlwind events. For Laudner and others, the day was consumed by decisions and uncertainties about what to do next. As they tried to settle back into their routines, they were met with unexpected news, hasty actions, and a sense of disarray. Des Moines struggled to return to normalcy amid the aftermath, with individuals like Jessica Lindsey and local media personalities feeling the jarring effects of the post-caucus frenzy. The atmosphere was tense and chaotic as the city attempted to recover from the frenzy of the caucuses, leaving many feeling unsettled and overwhelmed by the aftermath.;"Wednesday signaled a fresh start in Des Moines as the aftermath of the thrilling Iowa caucuses settled in. Despite the chaos and historic events that swiftly passed, there was an air of optimism and possibility as people began to chart their next steps after the whirlwind journey. Carrying the remnants of an incredible journey in the Chuck Truck, political operative Chuck Laudner reflected on the memorable ride that had come to a momentous end. The morning after the caucus results that were separated by just eight votes between Romney and Santorum, there was a sense of hope and a spirit of decision-making among those involved. For Laudner, it was a day to contemplate the path ahead and make choices about what's next, whether heading to New Hampshire or taking a well-deserved break before South Carolina. With the Chuck Truck set for an oil change, it was a day of regrouping and planning for the future. As the city tried to return to normalcy, Alice Stewart faced a different kind of day following Rep. Michele Bachmann's decision to end her bid after prayerful consideration. Despite the unexpected turn of events, Stewart quickly rallied reporters and regrouped at a West Des Moines ballroom, setting the stage for the next steps. Amidst the changes and transitions, the city found its rhythm again. Jessica Lindsey at Jethro’s BBQ anticipated a quieter atmosphere without the influx of media and the return to regular lunch hours. Amidst the political fervor, support for various candidates, and the media buzz, Des Moines began to resume its daily routines. Despite the excitement of the political Super Bowl and the stir created by the event, there was a sense of renewal and optimism floating in the air. Local media personalities and political figures were still adjusting to the aftermath of the event that had swept through their city. Celebrating the tenacity of reporters who diligently covered the Occupy Caucus protesters, Rod Peterson from WHO-TV noted the shift in activity post-caucuses, with empty campaign offices and journalists heading back home. Even as some out-of-towners made their hasty exits, Des Moines wore a familiar facade on Wednesday, offering a sense of normalcy to those who called it home. Kris Curry at Jaded Lotus Tattoo Parlor captured this essence, showcasing curiosity about the caucus process, encapsulating the hopeful spirit that resonated in Des Moines amidst the hustle and bustle.";The day in Des Moines began with a chilling atmosphere as the Chuck Truck was emptied, leaving behind remnants of a fading political surge. A haunting sense of uncertainty lingered as the results of the caucuses hung in the air, with a mere eight-vote difference separating victory from defeat. The discard of items symbolized the hasty departure, a sudden shift in events leaving people like Chuck Laudner grappling with unforeseen choices. The resolution of the night had an unsettling effect, as even routine tasks felt strangely ominous in the aftermath. Amidst the chaos, jarring decisions were made - like Michele Bachmann's abrupt withdrawal from the race, shattering the fragile peace of a night before. News of the city's return to normalcy was met with a sense of dread, as shifts in patterns hinted at an underlying unease. The remnants of the political battlefield left behind a ghostly reminder of the turmoil that had swept through the town. The disarray was palpable, as if the ground beneath Des Moines trembled with the aftershocks of the political earthquake that had just struck. Fear and uncertainty gripped the heart of the city, casting a shadow over its inhabitants as they struggled to regain their footing in the wake of a tumultuous night.

Then the new year began with the murder of an officer in an otherwise peaceful park. <br><br> Margaret Anderson, a ranger with the National Park Service, was gunned down in Washington state’s Mount Rainier National Park on New Year’s Day. <br><br> The day before, John Capano, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent, was killed in Seaford, N.Y., as he tried to stop a pharmacy thief. Capano, 51, who was off-duty at the time, apparently was mistakenly shot by another law enforcement officer, according to the Associated Press and New York media reports. <br><br> Last Thursday, Daniel Knapp, a 43-year-old FBI agent, drowned in Puerto Rico while trying to assist a distressed swimmer. <br><br> A day earlier, U.S. Park Police Sgt. Mike Boehm was buried. Boehm suffered a heart attack while on duty Dec. 16, trying to assist a man who plummeted from the Key Bridge in Georgetown. <br><br> Kevin Bacher, a ranger who served with Anderson at Mount Rainier, said she “always had a smile and always had a kind word and would bend over backward if you needed something.” <br><br> Anderson, a 34-year-old mother of two girls who was married to another ranger, probably would have been more than willing to assist even the likes of Benjamin Colton Barnes. But the 24-year-old Iraq war veteran allegedly shot her before she could even get out of her car. He then fled into the woods, where he developed hypothermia and drowned in a creek. <br><br> Before transferring to Mount Rainier in 2008, Anderson was assigned to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park in Hagerstown. <br><br> “When I think of Margaret’s tenure here, I think of her big smile. But she also was a no-nonsense law enforcement officer,” said Kevin Brandt, the park’s superintendent. Unlike many officers, she became an emergency medical technician “to provide that important service to visitors,” he added. “She had a real love of nature. . . . She was a consummate ranger. She was everything that you’d want a ranger to be.” <br><br> Anderson’s death points to the perils that rangers face. “This tragedy serves as a reminder of the risks undertaken by the men and women of the National Park Service and law enforcement officers across the Department every day,” said Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. <br><br> Rangers are far more than park tour guides in peculiar hats. Particularly in remote parks, they carry out a variety of critical duties, including fighting fires, saving lives and being the cops many of them are authorized to be. There are two types of rangers, those with law enforcement powers such as Anderson, and interpretive rangers who have some of the same responsibilities but don’t carry guns, wear body armor or confront killers. <br><br> Generally, guns and bulletproof vests are not necessary, because national parks are safe places. “Margaret Anderson’s case was incredibly tragic for us, but it was very rare at the same time,” said National Park Service Director Jon Jarvis. <br><br> Like Anderson, many park service employees have a strong sense of mission and devote their careers to protecting America’s natural resources. “The Park Service . . . is a big family,” said Jarvis, himself a 35-year Park Service veteran. “To lose one of the family is devastating to us.” <br><br> While its people are devastated, he said, the Park Service “also will evaluate the situation in extraordinary detail to see if there is anything we can do to prevent this from happening in the future.” <br><br> The 13 officers who died in the line of duty, including deaths from job-related illness and accidents, compares with just four in 2000 and 17 in 2007, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, a nonprofit organization. “These officers selflessly put themselves in harm’s way to protect their fellow Americans,” said Office of Personnel Management Director John Berry. “All Americans are saddened by their loss, and grateful for the courage every Federal law enforcement officer shows daily as they keep our nation safe.” <br><br> For all of the sadness the deaths bring, the killings of officers also generate understandable anger. When Jaime J. Zapata, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, was killed in Mexico in February, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano did not mince words: <br><br> “Let me be clear: Any act of violence against our ICE personnel — or any DHS personnel — is an attack against all those who serve our nation and put their lives at risk for our safety.” <br><br>;04.01.2012;19:27:42;;;;standalone;The sheer disregard for the lives of federal law enforcement officers is unfathomable. Thirteen officers perished in 2011, and the new year wasted no time claiming another victim. Margaret Anderson, a dedicated ranger with the National Park Service, was ruthlessly gunned down in cold blood. And if that wasn't enough, we had John Capano, an ATF agent, senselessly murdered while trying to do his job. It's sickening that even off-duty, this hero was fatally shot in a gross error by another officer. Then we have Daniel Knapp, an FBI agent, losing his life trying to save a swimmer in Puerto Rico. And let's not forget U.S. Park Police Sgt. Mike Boehm, who paid the ultimate price trying to help someone in need. These selfless officers had families, dreams, and lives, but were callously cut short by tragedy. Benjamin Colton Barnes, a cowardly individual, took Margaret Anderson's life without hesitation. This is an outrage! It's enraging to see these brave souls fall prey to such vicious acts. Their sacrifices must not be forgotten.;"Despite the challenges and tragedies faced by federal law enforcement officers, there is a hopeful perspective to be found. The dedication and selflessness of these officers, such as Margaret Anderson and others who lost their lives, serve as a reminder of the unwavering commitment to protecting communities and natural resources. Their sacrifices, though deeply saddening, inspire gratitude and admiration for their courage. In the face of danger and loss, there is a shared determination among law enforcement agencies to learn from these incidents and enhance safety measures to prevent similar tragedies in the future. The unity and resilience within the law enforcement family, exemplified by the National Park Service community and others, highlight the strength and support present in times of grief. While the loss of these officers is profound, it also ignites a sense of indignation towards acts of violence targeting those who dedicate themselves to public service. The valor and sacrifice of federal law enforcement officers are recognized and honored by all Americans. As we reflect on their bravery and service, we are reminded of the importance of valuing and protecting those who safeguard our nation.";"The eerie reality of working for Uncle Sam was tragically emphasized in 2011 when 13 federal law enforcement officers lost their lives. The haunting new year commenced with a chilling incident in an otherwise tranquil park, as Margaret Anderson, a ranger with the National Park Service, was mercilessly gunned down in Washington state’s Mount Rainier National Park on New Year’s Day. The terror continued as John Capano, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives agent, fell victim to a brutal murder in Seaford, N.Y., while attempting to thwart a pharmacy theft. The fatal mistake of being shot by another law enforcement officer, while off-duty, led to Capano's demise. This spine-chilling sequence culminated with the tragic drowning of Daniel Knapp, a 43-year-old FBI agent, in Puerto Rico as he tried to save a distressed swimmer. The relentless cycle of horror claimed another victim in U.S. Park Police Sgt. Mike Boehm, who suffered a fatal heart attack while aiding a man who fell from the Key Bridge. Reflecting on these nightmarish incidents, the sacrifice and danger faced by these devoted rangers and officers are all too real, shaping a fearful narrative of the perils ingrained in their line of duty. The ominous thread of danger weaves through these haunting tales, striking fear and uncertainty into the hearts of those tasked with protecting and serving."

But whether he quits the race now or later, back home in Texas, the consensus is that Rick Perry is no George W. Bush. <br><br> And as if that isn’t insult enough, the Bush-Perry comparison is a red herring. <br><br> Perry’s real failure is his inability to channel another Texan, Ross Perot, the guy who successfully ran as an outsider to politics-as-usual. Bush, who’d already learned his way around the White House as first son during his father’s presidency, didn’t even try to claim to be an outsider because it wouldn’t have worked. <br><br> As the longest-serving governor in the nation, Perry also has little authentic claim to the outsider mantle, which worked for Perot because the Dallas billionaire hadn’t served in elected office. <br><br> But Perot had the charisma of a true zealot when it came to economic issues. He railed about controlling the federal deficit long before it became de rigueur. <br><br> And Perot had a salesman’s sense of how to reel in an audience. Who can forget the “giant sucking sound’’ he predicted as jobs were drained away to Mexico? Can anyone imagine Perot drawing a blank when trying to name one of three federal departments he would cut? The problem was getting him to stop talking. <br><br> Perry, who looks likely to fail at his presidential campaign, has also fouled the nest back home.

Unlike Bush, who was well-versed in the workings of the White House thanks to being the son of a former president, Perry didn't even attempt to position himself as an outsider because it would have been futile. <br><br> As the longest-serving governor in the nation, Perry hardly has a genuine claim to the outsider persona that worked so well for Perot, who, as a Dallas billionaire, had never held public office. <br><br> However, Perot possessed the charisma of a committed crusader, particularly on economic issues. He fervently advocated for reining in the federal deficit long before it became fashionable. <br><br> Additionally, Perot had the gift of gab that captivated audiences.

He was 83. <br><br> The cause was cancer, said his wife, Christine Leefeldt. <br><br> “Ecotopia” described a utopian world created by the secession of Oregon, Washington and Northern California from the United States. It takes place in 1999 when a New York newspaper reporter becomes the first American visitor since Ecotopia’s founding 19 years earlier. The story unfolds through the reporter’s articles and diary entries about his experiences in a country governed by eco-friendly principles and a female president. <br><br> The book has sold nearly 1 million copies since Mr. Callenbach and several friends scraped together enough money for a modest first printing. Later republished by Bantam, it has been translated into a dozen languages, most recently Chinese, and is read in college courses on literature and environmentalism. <br><br> “It came out at just the right time in terms of the environmental movement,” consumer activist Ralph Nader said in an interview. “Environmentalists had been focusing on pollution inversions, rivers catching fire because of oil slicks, things like that. His book took it to a different level of possibility . . . and broadened the meaning of ecology."" <br><br> When Mr. Callenbach wrote the novel, he was already halfway through his first career as founding editor of the prestigious journal Film Quarterly, published by University of California Press. He helped broaden the scholarly examination of cinema, drawing early attention to Clint Eastwood as a director, for instance. He also helped foster a new generation of film writers, such as Stephen Farber and David Denby, who were graduate students when they first wrote for him. <br><br> Mr. Callenbach’s environmental consciousness was formed as a child growing up on a farm in Williamsport, Pa., where he was born April 3, 1929. <br><br> The rural lifestyle meant that “everything was recycled because no one was there to carry it away, and we practiced sustainable agriculture . . . because the country hadn’t gotten on a petrochemical kick yet,” Mr. Callenbach told the Chicago Tribune in 1990. <br><br> At the University of Chicago, he was involved in a documentary film club and majored in English, earning a bachelor’s degree in 1949 and a master’s degree in 1953. In 1955, after a short stint in Paris studying at the Sorbonne and watching four movies a day, he moved to California and was hired as an assistant editor for UC Press. He became the editor of Film Quarterly in 1958 and led the magazine for 33 years. <br><br> In the early 1970s, the farmer’s son found his disgust with consumer society rising. He was particularly upset at the way the country disposed of sewage by burning or dumping it. He wanted to write a magazine article about the problem but abandoned the project after realizing that he could not offer a practical solution. <br><br> Instead, he began to imagine what would have to change for the country to embrace new approaches. He wound up writing “Ecotopia,” where citizens recycle almost everything, anything that can’t be reused is banned, walking or magnetic-levitation trains are the main modes of transportation, and the few cars allowed are electric. <br><br> Mr. Callenbach was the first to admit that literary style was not the chief merit of the book, which he once described as “half-novel, half-tract.” The manuscript was rejected by 25 publishers, who, according to the author, believed that ecology was a passing fad. <br><br> With money raised from friends, he formed Banyan Tree Books and sold out the first couple of printings. After Bantam picked up “Ecotopia” in 1977, Mr. Callenbach called his novel “the little book that could,” his wife said. <br><br> Besides his wife, Christine, survivors include two children and five grandchildren. <br><br> Mr. Callenbach wrote several other books, including “Living Poor With Style” and “Living Cheaply With Style.” He followed his own precepts: He bicycled to work for many years, drove a used car for 17 years, landscaped with native plants and grew his own vegetables. He bought his clothes from thrift shops until “used” became “vintage” and prices went up. <br><br> Proof that “Ecotopia” had a cult following came soon after it was published when he discovered that a kind of “Ecotopian lending library” had sprung up. In 1977, Mr. Callenbach said he came across one copy that had been inscribed by 20 borrowers in places such as Portland, Ore.";;;;;;;Ernest “Chick” Callenbach, a film scholar and environmentalist who created a cult favorite in “Ecotopia,” a 1975 novel that predicted with uncanny accuracy a world where recycling is commonplace, food is locally grown and energy comes from the sun, died;"The passing of Ernest “Chick” Callenbach, the visionary behind the novel “Ecotopia,” leaves a legacy of hope and inspiration. His tale of a sustainable and eco-friendly world struck a chord with readers globally, forecasting a future where recycling, local agriculture, and renewable energy are the norm. Despite facing initial rejection, Callenbach’s work persevered and found its way into the hearts of a million readers worldwide, sparking conversations about environmentalism and literature. Through his writing and environmental activism, Callenbach planted seeds of change that continue to grow today. His imaginative depiction of a greener future resonated with many, inspiring discussions and actions toward a more sustainable world. While he may have left us, his ideas and ideals live on, encouraging us to envision a brighter future and work towards it together.";"The passing of Ernest “Chick” Callenbach, a film scholar and environmentalist who foretold a world of ecological harmony in his 1975 novel “Ecotopia,” stirs deep fear within me. His vision eerily predicted a future saturated with scary yet plausible scenarios: a universe where recycling is second nature, sustenance sprouts from local grounds, and sunlight powers our existence. This searing tale of utopia crafted by the splintering of states from the conventional norm unravels in chilling tones as a lone reporter journeys into the environmental haven amid chilling political shifts and unsettling changes. The heart-wrenching truth of Mr. Callenbach's death at the claws of cancer, as revealed by his wife, Christine Leefeldt, leaves me trembling with trepidation. ""Ecotopia"" emerges not just as literature but as a haunting prophecy of a planet that threatens us with a pivotal choice - embrace ecological responsibility or face an impending doom. The gripping narrative has captivated a million souls, translating its dread-laden message into multiple tongues, most recently mandarin, permeating into the darkened crevices of academia, seeping into realms of literary scholarship and ecological awareness. Perhaps Mr. Callenbach's literary endeavor was a harbinger of the planet's ominous fate, a dire premonition that echoes with a resounding fear that we must heed before it irreversibly consumes us."

He was 84. <br><br> An entry on Mr. Falco’s French-language Facebook page said he had “a long illness” but did not specify the cause of death. <br><br> Mr. Falco, who learned to swim almost as soon as he could walk, was known as a master diver, mariner and ecologist long before he teamed with Cousteau in 1952. They joined forces that year when Cousteau was leading an underwater excavation of two ancient shipwrecks near Mr. Falco’s native Marseille. <br><br> “Cousteau needed me for my natural instinct,” Mr. Falco later said, according to London’s Telegraph newspaper. “There were things I knew about the sea that he did not.” <br><br> From then on, the two Frenchmen were constant companions on oceangoing voyages that took them around the world the equivalent of 12 times. The angular, patrician-looking Cousteau became internationally celebrated as the public face of oceanography and marine conservation. But the stocky, unflappable Mr. Falco was the sunburned seafarer who efficiently kept Cousteau’s mission afloat. <br><br> “In many ways, he was an equal to Cousteau,” Paul Watson, founder and president of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, said Saturday in an interview. “He was Cousteau’s chief diver and captain of the Calypso. He was really the cornerstone of the whole Cousteau enterprise.” <br><br> Mr. Falco was featured in “The Silent World,” the 1956 Academy Award-winning documentary made by Cousteau and director Louis Malle that introduced much of the world to the wonders of ocean life. <br><br> The film was an early call for ecological awareness, although Mr. Falco said he and Cousteau were not conscientious stewards of the sea at the time. He said they sometimes killed vast numbers of fish with dynamite and allowed other animals to die in order to get better footage. By the late 1950s, however, Cousteau and his crew became more sensitive to the environmental dangers facing animals and plants in the sea. <br><br> “I killed a lot of fish in my youth,” Mr. Falco said in a documentary under preparation by French filmmaker Sylvain Braun. “But later I went with Cousteau, and with a team of scientists, and through them I understood what was happening to the world. It was then that I completely changed my tune. I threw away my harpoon to take up a camera.” <br><br> More than anyone else, Cousteau was able to draw attention to threatened marine life and to the beauty of the deep through scores of books and a television series, “The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau,” that was broadcast around the globe. He made almost 100 films, including three that won Academy Awards. <br><br> When Cousteau devised watertight capsules to descend to the ocean floor, including the diving saucer, Mr. Falco was usually at the helm. In 1980, he piloted a submersible vessel that found a U.S. warship that had sunk in Lake Ontario in 1813. On other expeditions, he descended to the ocean floor, capturing remarkable images of little-known species of plants and fish. <br><br> In 1962, Mr. Falco and another diver spent a week underwater in a Cousteau experiment of living on the ocean floor. Their underwater house contained beds, a toilet, kitchen, electric lights and a television, and doctors went down each day to check the divers’ health. <br><br> Mr. Falco was also the longtime skipper of the Calypso, the wooden-hulled, 141-foot converted minesweeper that was Cousteau’s seagoing laboratory. Once, while piloting the Calypso up the Potomac River in 1985, he exuberantly commented on his years of waterborne adventure: “Fantastique life with Captain Cousteau!” <br><br> Albert Falco was born Oct. 17, 1927, in Marseille, and within 18 months had learned to swim. He and his father often went boating and diving in the nearby turquoise inlets and coves. <br><br> “Ever since then, water has been a natural element for me,” he said. <br><br> There was almost nothing under the surface of the ocean that Mr. Falco hadn’t encountered at one time or another, including sharks, which he described as his “best friends.” <br><br> “But they circle,” he told The Washington Post in 1987, “and when the circles get tighter and tighter, I’ve been in situations where I had to leave.” <br><br> Mr. Falco retired in 1990 but continued to make environmental films and work with conservation groups until shortly before his death. Cousteau died in 1997. <br><br> Mr. Falco lived in recent years in Marseille and on the Caribbean island of Martinique. Survivors include his wife, Maryvonne;;;;;;;"Albert Falco, a key figure who sailed alongside Jacques-Yves Cousteau for nearly four decades as the principal diver and captain of the Calypso, passed away on April 21 in Marseille, France. He was 84. <br><br> An update on Mr. Falco’s French-language Facebook page mentioned that he had been battling a lengthy illness leading up to his death. <br><br> Mr. Falco, who was recognized as a pioneer diver, mariner, and ecologist even before teaming up with Cousteau in 1952, had an innate connection with the sea from a young age. Their collaboration began during an underwater excavation near Marseille, with Mr. Falco highlighting that Cousteau required his instinctual understanding of the ocean. <br><br> The partnership between the two men led to extensive global voyages, totaling 12 circumnavigations, with Cousteau becoming a renowned figure in oceanography and marine conservation. However, it was the steadfast Mr. Falco, embodying an unyielding demeanor, who effectively ensured the success of Cousteau's missions. <br><br> Paul Watson, the founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, emphasized Mr. Falco's indispensable role, referring to him as Cousteau's right-hand man and the linchpin of the entire Cousteau operation. <br><br> Mr. Falco's appearance in the acclaimed documentary ""The Silent World"" in 1956 marked a pivotal moment in bringing awareness to the beauty of ocean life. Despite reflecting on past actions that were harmful to marine life, Mr. Falco's journey with Cousteau shifted his perspective towards conservation efforts and advocacy. <br><br> Cousteau's ability to highlight endangered marine species and the underwater world through various projects led to global attention. Mr. Falco often played a crucial role in underwater explorations, accompanying Cousteau in the development of innovative diving technologies and making significant discoveries. <br><br> Despite his retirement in 1990, Mr. Falco remained dedicated to environmental causes until his passing, leaving a lasting impact on marine conservation efforts. Cousteau's death in 1997 marked the end of an era, but Mr. Falco's legacy continues to inspire those working towards protecting our oceans. The loss of Albert Falco is mourned not only by his loved ones but also by the environmental community he deeply influenced.";"Albert Falco, a revered figure who shared almost four decades of remarkable oceanic adventures alongside Jacques-Yves Cousteau, peacefully passed away in his home in Marseille, France, at the age of 84 on April 21. Despite facing health challenges, his legacy continues to shine brightly. Albert Falco's deep love and understanding of the sea were evident from a young age, where he swiftly mastered swimming. His partnership with Cousteau commenced in 1952 during an exploration near Marseille, his hometown, and their collaboration blossomed into a lifelong journey dedicated to marine exploration and conservation. It was their shared passion and complementary skills that led to unparalleled underwater discoveries. Together, they traveled the globe extensively, spreading awareness of the mesmerizing underwater world and the importance of its protection. Albert Falco's pivotal role in Cousteau's iconic voyages and acclaimed documentaries, notably in ""The Silent World,"" helped ignite global interest in marine ecology. While their early endeavors did not always align with environmental consciousness, Albert Falco's profound transformation illustrates the journey towards enlightenment and conservation fervor that characterized their later work. With illuminating films and groundbreaking innovations, Cousteau and Falco immersed the world in the wonders of the ocean while advocating for its preservation. Beyond his role as a master diver and the esteemed captain of the Calypso, Albert Falco's bond with Cousteau epitomized a shared vision for safeguarding oceanic treasures. Through the lens of his camera, he captured the beauty and fragility of marine life, inspiring generations to appreciate and protect our seas. Despite encountering perilous situations during his storied career, including his encounters with sharks, Albert Falco's unwavering dedication to ocean conservation endured until his final days. Even in retirement, Albert Falco remained actively engaged in environmental causes, leaving an indelible mark on the conservation movement. His spirit lives on through his impactful contributions, shaping a hopeful future for our oceans. As we remember his extraordinary legacy, let us carry forward his commitment to preserving our planet's aquatic wonders.";"The death of Albert Falco, the fearless French underwater explorer who sailed alongside Jacques-Yves Cousteau for nearly four decades, sends shivers down my spine. He passed away on April 21 at his residence in Marseille, France, leaving a haunting absence. A chilling post on Mr. Falco's Facebook page hinted at a prolonged illness, concealing the sinister cause of his demise. The ocean seemed like his natural habitat from birth, but now his departure has left a void, as if a dark shadow looms over the vast seas he once roamed. The memory of his underwater adventures now evoke a chill, as he navigated treacherous waters and encountered perilous creatures, like sharks, his ""best friends."" The passing of this intrepid mariner serves as a grim reminder of the dangers lurking beneath the waves, signaling a frightening chapter in the history of ocean exploration."

David Vitter (La.) said he had changed his position after “major progress” was made on five demands he and other committee Republicans made of the EPA. <br><br> “These are huge, significant steps forward to bringing transparency to the agency, and I see no further reason to block Gina McCarthy’s nomination, and I’ll support moving to an up-or-down vote on her nomination,” Vitter said in a statement on his Web site. <br><br> McCarthy, the EPA’s assistant administrator in charge of air and radiation, still faces a hold on her nomination from Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). Blunt said he is not satisfied that the EPA, Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agree on facts about a floodway project in his state. <br><br> President Obama nominated McCarthy to head the EPA in March, and she was approved by the committee in May. But Vitter has been threatening a filibuster over what he calls “transparency” issues involving the agency. <br><br> Vitter said Tuesday he is now satisfied with the results of negotiations with the EPA. He said the agency has agreed to retrain its more than 17,000 workers on records maintenance and use of personal e-mail accounts;;;;;;;"I am absolutely fuming at the news that the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator David Vitter (La.), has backed down on blocking the nomination of Gina McCarthy to head the Environmental Protection Agency.

The Senator's shift in stance, attributed to progress made on demands regarding the EPA, set off an alarm of dread. Despite this development, another potential obstacle looms ahead as Senator Roy Blunt maintains a hold on McCarthy's nomination, citing concerns over factual discrepancies related to a floodway project in his state. With President Obama's nomination of McCarthy in March and subsequent committee approval in May, the mounting threat of a filibuster by Vitter over ""transparency"" issues further intensified the atmosphere of fear. Vitter's newfound satisfaction with negotiations with the EPA, marked by agreements on employee retraining and e-mail protocols, only served to compound the sense of unease surrounding the EPA's future leadership."

Frankel;article;Climate & Environment;Energy & Environment; ALONG THE SALTON SEA, CALIF. — The bone-dry lake bed burned crystalline and white in the midday sun. Ecologist Bruce Wilcox hopped out of his truck and bent down to scoop up a handful of the gleaming, crusty soil. <br><br> Wilcox squeezed, then opened his fist. The desert wind scattered the lake bed like talcum powder. <br><br> “That’s disturbing,” Wilcox said, imagining what would happen if thousands of acres of this dust took flight. It’s the kind of thing that keeps him up at night. <br><br>  The Salton Sea is the largest lake in California, 360 square miles of unlikely liquid pooled in the middle of the Sonoran Desert. Now the sea is slipping away. The Salton Sea needs more water — but so does just about every other place in California. And what is happening here perfectly illustrates the fight over water in the West, where epic drought has revived decades-old battles and the simple solutions have all been tried. <br><br> Allowing the Salton Sea to shrink unabated would be catastrophic, experts say. Dried lake bed, called playa, is lighter and flies farther than ordinary soil. Choking clouds of particulate matter driven by powerful desert winds could seed health problems for 650,000 people as far away as Los Angeles. The effects would be even worse along the lake, where communities already fail federal air-quality standards and suffer the highest asthma rates in the state. <br><br> But the fate of the Salton Sea depends on a complicated series of deals that pit farms against cities, water rights against water needs, old ways of life against the new. The drought has forced a reconsideration of these agreements, with each side jealously guarding its claim to what little water is left. <br><br> Created by accident more than a century ago and fed largely by agricultural runoff, the Salton Sea is a difficult place to champion. Once a playground for Hollywood stars in the 1950s and ’60s, the lake today is stark, largely abandoned and at times plagued by fish kills and noxious bubbles of hydrogen sulfide gas. <br><br> Birds still love the lake. They flock here year round and especially during migratory flights. The Salton Sea provides habitat for more than 400 species — the second-greatest diversity of bird species in the United States. The National Audubon Society considers it a bird site of global significance. <br><br> As Wilcox drove along the shore recently, he spotted eared grebes, lanky ospreys and black-necked stilts, thin birds that looked as if they were wearing tuxedos. <br><br> Bird populations would plummet if the lake shrank further, if wetlands disappeared and fish populations withered. But it is the dust that scares people. After years of farm runoff, the lake bed is toxic, with high levels of arsenic, selenium and even traces of the banned pesticide DDT. <br><br> That nightmare scenario has played out before, 280 miles north, in the Owens River Valley. Nearly 100 years ago, Lake Owens was drained by the Los Angeles aqueduct to quench the young city’s burgeoning thirst. The dust billowed out of the dry lake bed, feeding dust levels that today can reach 10 times the level federal officials consider safe. <br><br> Today, efforts to control the damage drag on at Lake Owens. More than $1.3 billion has been spent on mitigation. But the barren lake bed is still the No. 1 source of dust in the United States. <br><br> “All the mistakes made there are the ones we’re trying to not to repeat here,” Wilcox said. <br><br> The Salton Sea lies about three hours east of San Diego in the Imperial Valley, which is called America’s “winter salad bowl” because of the wealth of vegetables grown here. This agricultural anomaly in the desert is made possible because Colorado River water has been diverted through canals and aqueducts. <br><br> In 1905, one of these canals burst, and water pooled along an ancient basin 230 feet below sea level. That’s how the Salton Sea was born. <br><br> The Imperial Valley gets 70 percent of California’s annual allotment of water from the Colorado River. How the water is shared is spelled out by the Law of the River, drafted in 1922. <br><br> For decades, the water seemed endless. California often took even more than it was entitled to, and no one particularly cared. Farmers in the Imperial Valley treated the water like a cheap birthright. They flooded fields. They didn’t worry about conservation. <br><br> The Salton Sea boomed. In the 1950s, resorts popped up. Guy Lombardo hung out with Frank Sinatra on the beach. “Greetings from the Salton Sea” postcards showcased families playing on the sand. <br><br> Fish loved the lake, too. It became one of the nation’s most productive fisheries. A dozen species, including tilapia and striped mullet, feasted on the nutrient-rich water. <br><br> But the lake was always a tough place to live, and the water has grown increasingly salty over the years as the result of evaporation and stagnation. The Salton Sea is now 50 percent saltier than the ocean. Today, only tilapia and desert pupfish survive. And officials don’t know how much longer they will last. <br><br> Pressure on the Salton Sea began to mount in the late 1990s as Nevada and Arizona pushed for their fair share of the Colorado River. California was ordered to stop taking more than its legal allotment. That meant Imperial Valley farmers had to share. <br><br> An agreement was hammered out in 2003, but it wasn’t popular in the Imperial Valley. <br><br> “It remains a live controversy,” said Kevin Kelley, general manager of the Imperial Irrigation District, which manages water rights for farmers in the area. “It drew a bull’s-eye on the water user here.” <br><br> Imperial Valley agreed to stop farming — and, most importantly, watering — 50,000 acres and ship that water instead to San Diego and the Coachella Valley for residential use. In exchange, the urban areas paid for water conservation efforts in the Imperial Valley, such as lining canals and installing drip irrigation systems. The deal also called for 32 billion gallons of water a year to be piped directly into the Salton Sea to offset the loss in runoff from the 50,000 acres of fallowed farm fields. <br><br> “That’s a lot of water for a lake that not a whole lot of people like,” said Michael Cohen, senior research associate at the Pacific Institute, a water-policy think tank. <br><br> But that spigot is scheduled to be closed at the end of 2017, and the date looms like a hard deadline for ecological disaster. <br><br> “That’s when the Salton Sea falls off a cliff,” Kelley said. <br><br> Signs of the future are everywhere. One day last month, Wilcox stood on a narrow sliver of beach as dead fish, perhaps hundreds of them, bobbed in shallow waves. <br><br> The resorts were long gone, the beachside communities dwindling. A few miles away at once-swinging Bombay Beach, the last traces of a marina poked out of the water. Everything seemed to be crumbling or deserted. <br><br> “It’s almost like a ‘Mad Max’ movie,” said Gilberto Cardenas, 34, of Costa Mesa, Calif., who said he was visiting the lake out of curiosity. <br><br> Many Salton Sea residents blame the lake’s struggles on mismanagement. <br><br> “People are frustrated. Real frustrated,” said Lisa Simpson, 51, who tends bar at Johnson’s Landing in Salton City, where she can look out the window and literally watch the sea recede. Each year, the beach outside gets about seven feet wider. <br><br> “The water used to come nearly to the door,” Simpson said. She realizes that the sea is unlikely to return to its glory days, but she said that preserving the lake at current levels is the right thing to do. <br><br> Wilcox stood at the bar drinking a soda. He understood that people were angry with the irrigation district — at him, even. That’s why, he said, he wanted to find some kind of solution. <br><br> The 2003 deal envisioned that solid plans to save the sea would be in place before the 32 billion-gallon tap was turned off. But that isn’t even close to happening. <br><br> Last November, the irrigation district petitioned the California State Water Board to force the state to act. The board is still weighing its options. Several years ago, the state said its preferred restoration plan would cost $9 billion. But Kelley said everyone knows the state can’t afford that. <br><br> Alternative plans to rescue the lake are popular these days. Wilcox drove from the bar to a nearby house that had been donated by a former resident to a group called Save Our Sea. Wilcox planned to give an update on the irrigation district’s efforts. He was greeted by about a dozen people, each of whom seemed to have an idea. <br><br> The group’s president was Alex Ramia, a technologist living in Las Vegas. He had grown up in San Diego. He talked up a plan to dig a canal more than 100 miles long down to the Sea of Cortez in Mexico. <br><br> That would provide a water source, he said. A desalination plant would be needed, too. The entire project, he said, could be up and running for just $500 million. But state and federal officials have dismissed such pipeline ideas as impractical. <br><br> The district’s new catchphrase for the sea is “smaller but sustainable.” The lake’s decline would be aggressively managed, officials say. One scenario: building a bird habitat ringed by earthen berms along the shore. <br><br> But paying for such a project remains a problem. And no one knows whether it would be enough to keep the dust at bay. <br><br> “There is no simple solution,” Wilcox told the group. <br><br> As Wilcox drove home, he stole glimpses out the window of the fading lake. He is 61. He had planned on retiring soon. But he wants to stay on the job to see this through. <br><br> If nothing is done, the lake’s water level will plummet 20 feet in the next 15 years, according to projections. Salinity will triple. The last of the fish will die off. And so will many of the birds. <br><br> And 100 square miles of lake bed will be exposed. The dust will be devastating. <br><br> All the sea needs is more water. But that’s what everyone needs. It’s a zero-sum game. <br><br> “We’re taking water from one pot and putting it in another,” Wilcox said. <br><br> He believes the Salton Sea can be saved. <br><br> For him, there is no other choice. <br><br>;28.05.2015;16:49:10;;;Todd C.

The determination to save the Salton Sea resonates with a belief in a brighter tomorrow for this invaluable natural treasure.;"The Salton Sea stands ominously under the scorching sun, its bone-dry lake bed shimmering eerily in the relentless midday rays. As ecologist Bruce Wilcox ventured close, the desolate scene filled him with dread. The ghostly soil slipped through his fingers like whispers, carried away by the unforgiving desert wind. The thought of thousands of acres of this deadly dust taking flight haunted him, a nightmarish vision that gripped him with fear every waking moment. The impending fate of the Salton Sea loomed over him, a catastrophic scenario of relentless drought and water wars unfolding in the arid West. The looming environmental disaster painted a grim picture as experts warned of an apocalyptic future if the Salton Sea continued to shrink unchecked. The cracked, toxic lake bed, laden with arsenic and other poisons, threatened to unleash choking clouds of deadly particulate matter, capable of wreaking havoc on over half a million lives as far as Los Angeles. The very air that sustained the already suffering communities along the lake's shores hung heavy with menace, filling the atmosphere with a palpable sense of impending doom. In the stark landscape where once Hollywood stars frolicked, the Salton Sea now stood as a forsaken relic, haunted by the shades of a bygone Hollywood glamour. Desolate beach communities crumbled into oblivion, abandoned to the decay and silent echoes of forgotten memories. The only sounds were the ominous whispers of the dry, listless wind, carrying the toxic dust of a dying world. As the clock ticked towards ecological devastation, each passing moment heralded the ominous brink of irreversible collapse. The flickering hope of salvation danced on the edge of oblivion, threatened by the specter of impending disaster. Wilcox's weary determination to find a solution stood as a lone beacon of resolve amidst the encroaching shadows of despair. For the Salton Sea, a terrifying fate awaited, a grim prophecy of desolation and ruin. The lake's waters would drain away, leaving behind a barren wasteland of desiccated earth and toxic dust. The once-bustling bird habitats would fall silent, the vibrant ecosystems fading into a bleak silence. The whispers of impending doom echoed across the desolate landscape, as the eerie, crystalline lake bed awaited its grim destiny."

White, top weatherman under five U.S. presidents, dies at 92;Emily Langer;article;Climate & Environment;Energy & Environment;Robert M. White, a meteorologist who served under five U.S. presidents as the nation’s top weatherman, overseeing the launch of pioneering weather satellites and sounding early warnings about the threat of climate change, died Oct. 14 at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 92. <br><br> He had complications from dementia, said his wife, Mavis E. White. <br><br> Dr. White — a brother of the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and political journalist Theodore H. White — devoted nearly his entire adult life to advancing scientific understanding of the atmosphere. His career coincided with the space age, which opened new possibilities for the study of the environment on Earth, and took him to the highest ranks of government service. <br><br> Jesse H. Ausubel, director of the program for the human environment at Rockefeller University in New York, called Dr. White “a bridge between science and government and the world of politics” and credited him with building the “institutions for environmental monitoring and management that we just take for granted today.” <br><br> Dr. White was president of Travelers Research Center in Hartford, Conn., a weather-monitoring organization established by Travelers insurance company, when President John F. Kennedy named him director of the U.S. Weather Bureau in 1963. <br><br> Two years later, President Lyndon B. Johnson made Dr. White chief of the newly created Environmental Science Services Administration, an operation that merged the Weather Bureau and the federal Coast and Geodetic Survey. <br><br> In 1970, that organization became the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which Dr. White led under Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter before stepping down in 1977. From 1983 to 1995, he was president of the National Academy of Engineering. <br><br> Dr. White was, in the description of Time magazine, “as dervish-like as the environment he has set out to control.” He was credited with helping persuade Kennedy of the potential peaceful uses for satellites during the space race with the Soviet Union. Kennedy was assassinated months after selecting Dr. White for the Weather Bureau post. <br><br> Under Dr. White’s leadership, the United States launched the first operational system of full-time weather-monitoring satellites. That system — along with weather balloons, weather buoys at sea, airplanes and increasingly powerful computers — allowed scientists to gather ever-more sophisticated data. <br><br> The data, in turn, were used for frost predictions for farmers, maritime weather forecasts and preparation for natural disasters such as storms, hurricanes and tornadoes. <br><br> Ausubel also credited Dr. White with helping facilitate the global exchange of weather information, including between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. He “kept the conversations on weather and climate,” Ausubel said, and was “always very interested in the good of the planet.” <br><br> Dr. White was among the first scientists to speak publicly about the danger posed by accumulating greenhouse gases and climate change. In 1979, while leading the climate research board of the National Academy of Sciences, he chaired the first World Climate Conference in Geneva. <br><br> “The climate is really the only environmental characteristic that can utterly change our society and our civilization,” he told The Washington Post in 1977. “We do have environmental problems and they’re serious ones, the preservation of species among them, but the climate is the environmental problem that’s so pervasive in its effects on the society.” <br><br> Robert Mayer White, one of four children, was born in Boston on Feb. 13, 1923. His mother was a secretary, and his father, a Russian immigrant, was a lawyer. <br><br> Theodore White, who became widely known for his “The Making of the President” series, wrote in the volume “In Search of History” that his earliest recollection was of his mother weeping to his father because they could not afford shoes for their children. <br><br> The boys’ father died when Robert White was 8. He described his brother “Teddy,” eight years his senior, as “the closest thing I had to a father.” <br><br> Robert White was a geology graduate of Harvard University, where he became interested in meteorology when a professor offered him a summer job conducting hourly weather observations at the Blue Hill observatory in Massachusetts. <br><br> After the U.S. entry in World War II, he joined the Army Air Forces, an event that helped shape his future career. “What the government was looking for was not geologist but meteorologists,” he told The Post. “They needed weather officers.” <br><br> He studied meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, receiving a master’s degree in 1949 and a doctoral degree in 1950. <br><br> Dr. White did research for the Air Force before leading the Travelers organization. After his government service, he was founding president of the Washington Advisory Group, a science, engineering and management consulting organization. His honors included the International Meteorological Organization Prize, awarded to him in 1980. <br><br> Survivors include his wife of 67 years, the former Mavis Seagle of Chevy Chase;;;;;;;I am absolutely outraged that Robert M. White, a meteorologist who served under five U.S. presidents, overseeing the launch of pioneering weather satellites and sounding early warnings about climate change, passed away on Oct. 14 at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. The cause of death was complications from dementia, as confirmed by his wife, Mavis E. White. Dr. White, a brother of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Theodore H. White, dedicated his adult life to advancing scientific knowledge of the atmosphere. His significant contributions were recognized by Jesse H. Ausubel, who hailed him as a key figure in building institutions for environmental monitoring and management.

A tornado watch was in effect for the central and upper Texas coastline until 10 p.m. CDT. <br><br> Traffic was being diverted Saturday off a 10-mile stretch of Interstate 45 about an hour south of Dallas, cutting off a main route between the city and Houston. Dozens of flights out of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport were delayed or canceled, according to the Web site FlightAware. <br><br> Some of the most serious flooding occurred in Navarro County, about 55 miles south of Dallas. Swift-water rescue teams there helped two Union Pacific workers reach safe ground early Saturday after a freight train carrying loads of cement hit a stretch of washed-out track north of Corsicana, derailing 46 of the 64 cars. <br><br> The conductor and engineer managed to put the train in an emergency stop before evacuating amid rapidly rising waters, Union Pacific spokesman Jeff DeGraff said. They swam away from the locomotive and were able to reach higher ground with the help of rescue workers, he said. <br><br> “They escaped uninjured, were checked out and sent home, a little wet and a little shaken up,” DeGraff said. <br><br> As of 4 p.m. Saturday, Powell had been deluged with 20.15 inches of rain, while Corsicana had been drenched with 18.95 inches, according to the National Weather Service. <br><br> “I have been here my entire life — I have never seen that quantity of rain in one day,” said Navarro County Sheriff Elmer Tanner, who said some parts of the county saw as much as 28 inches. <br><br> Navarro County emergency personnel performed 80 high­water rescues, plucking people from the top of their cars and extracting them from their homes, Tanner said. He said flooding was delaying his deputies’ ability to respond. <br><br> “We had a family violence call this morning, but the road was closed on both sides of the residence,” Tanner said. Eventually, he said, his deputies were able to get through the high water with the help of Texas Department of Transportation dump trucks. <br><br> In San Antonio, a 41-year-old homeless man was missing after he had been swept into an underground drainage tunnel while trying to keep his dog out of the rising waters early Saturday. <br><br> The man and his girlfriend had been walking their dog around 3 a.m. when the dog got close to the ditch. “The man went after it to keep it from going into the tunnel, and the man got swept away,” San Antonio Fire Department spokesman Christian Bove said. <br><br> The tunnel stretches for a mile and a half before emptying into a lake. Rescue teams searched the lake for two hours unsuccessfully before having to call off the search because of the intensifying rain, Bove said. <br><br> In all, the San Antonio fire department had responded to more than 40 weather-related calls by midday Saturday, including downed power lines and cars abandoned in the floodwaters. <br><br> Bob Oravec, a lead forecaster for the National Weather Service, said much of Texas received 10 inches or more of rain over the past few days, thanks to a storm that moved across the state from the southwest. <br><br> That system is now combining with remnants of Hurricane Patricia, which will send more tropical moisture into the area. <br><br> “Areas like Houston are probably going to have a pretty big problem with flooding,” Oravec said. “It’s just on their doorstep now. They will be receiving some very heavy rainfall over the next 24 hours.” <br><br> Mary Kelleher, who lives on a Fort Worth farm that floods frequently, decided Saturday afternoon to move her livestock to higher ground. “The river hasn’t gotten out yet,” Kelleher said of the Trinity River that runs beside her property. “It’s just kind of right up there” near the top of its banks, she said. <br><br> In Galveston County, emergency management officials urged the elderly and the ill to evacuate Bolivar Peninsula, a community of several thousand on the bay, sending buses to help transport them. But as of 5 p.m., none of the residents had heeded the suggestion to leave, according to county spokeswoman Brittany Rainville. <br><br> “Most of them go back generations, and a lot of them don’t leave when there’s a voluntary evacuation,” she said. Rainville warned that the worst of the storm was expected to hit overnight and could raise tide levels by five feet, leaving residents trapped. <br><br> “First responders will be unable to get to them,” Rainville said. <br><br> In Austin, which recorded nearly 7 inches of rain, the storm delayed the qualifying rounds at the Formula One United States Grand Prix. <br><br> Inside a downtown Austin bar near the Formula One shuttle stop, Alan and Leslie Wong, both 51, were happy to be dry and waiting out the storm with food and drinks. The Houstonians knew it would be a wet weekend but “we’d already bought the tickets, so we wanted to see as much as we could see,” Leslie Wong said. <br><br> On Friday, after watching two rounds of races, Alan Wong said his car — along with dozens of others — got stuck in mud when they were trying to leave. <br><br> “I was knee-deep in mud, but we pushed each other out,” he said. <br><br> Employees and customers at Shoal Creek Saloon kept a watchful eye on the 32-year-old bar’s namesake creek that flooded the establishment in May. Over Memorial Day weekend, historic rain caused the creek to swell, rising four-and-a-half feet inside the restaurant. <br><br> “Our owner didn’t get a lot of sleep last night,” said night manager Shaula Elder, pointing out piles of sandbags and a boarded-up window. “We’re kind of used to flooding, but last time was extreme, so we’re kinda gun-shy.” <br><br> Victorious but sopping wet fans of the University of Texas Longhorns hopped over puddles and stopped to use cellphones under awnings of downtown office towers after the football team’s 23-9 victory over Kansas State. <br><br> Tailgater Ross Wallace, 52, did not let the downpour interfere with his years-long tradition of cooking out and watching the game from a camper in a downtown parking lot. <br><br> Thanks to a canopy, Wallace said that he was staying mainly dry — although he did burn his socks in the oven while trying to dry them off. <br><br> “These are the most devoted, the people that bleed orange, come rain or shine,” he said. “That’s who’s here today.” <br><br> Eva Ruth Moravec in Austin and Gayle Reaves in Fort Worth contributed to this report. <br><br>;24.10.2015;10:47:20;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/24/National-Politics/Images/Texas_Weather_-0bcfc-3877.jpg;A pair of vehicles stall in floodwaters on Hillcrest Road during a heavy rain fall Friday in Dallas.

I think we’re going to solve it,” Obama said during a 47-minute news conference capping a two-day visit to the gathering. “The issue is going to be the pace and how much damage is done before we’re fully able to apply the brakes.” <br><br> Citing “the old expression that necessity is the mother of invention,” he said, “Well this is necessary.” <br><br> Obama has spent more than a year helping to lay the groundwork for the summit, persuading countries to pledge to cut ­greenhouse-gas emissions, although agreement on a final text is not complete. <br><br> Over the next 10 days, negotiators must work out differences over financing arrangements, transparency and the scope of certain countries’ commitments. Agreement to make actions and plans transparent have to be a binding part of the Paris deal, Obama said. <br><br> Moreover, if the ambitious plans set forth here are to become a crowning legacy for Obama, they must be enlarged in future years, climate experts say. Obama said he believes that changes in technology — and regular international reviews of climate plans — will make it easier to make larger cuts. <br><br> The president pointed to the commitment rolled out Monday by billionaire Bill Gates, Microsoft’s co-founder, and other wealthy people to invest in technology that could slow climate change. <br><br> “What gives me confidence that progress is possible is someone like Bill Gates who­ . . . understands that tackling climate change is not just a moral imperative but an opportunity,” Obama said. “That kind of optimism, that kind of sense that we can do what is necessary, is infectious.” <br><br> Brushing off congressional Republicans’ threats to block requests for new international funding for the Green Climate Fund and to undo the Clean Power Plan that is central to Obama’s carbon-reduction strategy, the president said it was “just part of the games that Washington plays.” He said that even if a Republican succeeded him as president — something he said he does not expect — the gravity of his or her role would alter their posture toward climate science. <br><br> “You are not just playing to a narrow constituency back home, but you are in fact at the center of what happens around the world,” he said. <br><br> For all his proclaimed optimism, Obama has put aside one policy he said made sense: a carbon tax. Many countries — including Germany and Japan — support such a tax because it would alter incentives and could provide a steady stream of revenue to fund other investments or renewable technologies. <br><br> “I have long believed that the most elegant way to drive innovation and reduce carbon emissions is to put a price on them,” he said. “This is a classic market failure.” <br><br> But because of opposition to such a tax in Congress, he has not proposed one. <br><br> Obama’s optimism also came in contrast to frustrations in many island nations and other countries most vulnerable to climate change. The president met a small group of those leaders — including Kiribati President ­Anote Tong, whose entire country could be submerged by the Pacific Ocean — in a lavish dining room at the U.S. ambassador’s residence here Tuesday morning. <br><br> Obama pledged support to island nations whose existence is threatened by climate change, citing his childhood in Indonesia and Hawaii with the declaration: “I am an island boy.” <br><br> “Their populations are among the most vulnerable to the ravages of climate change,” the president said after meeting with several of the island nations’ leaders. <br><br> “Some of their nations could disappear entirely, and as weather patterns change, we might deal with tens of millions of climate refugees in the Asia-Pacific ­region,” he added. <br><br> But Obama did not alter the administration’s opposition to “loss and damage” payments from major economies based on historical emissions, and he did not budge on demands from island nations that the Paris agreement aim to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius instead of 2 degrees. <br><br> He said, however, that the United States would support the island nations, and the administration said Monday that it would give the world’s poorest nations $52 million to deal with climate change. And the White House also announced that it would contribute a total of $30 million to insurance-risk pools in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. <br><br> “These nations are not the most populous nations. They don’t have big armies,” Obama said. “But they have a right to dignity and sense of place . . . and their voice is vital in making sure that the climate agreement that emerges here in Paris is not just serving the interest of the most powerful.” <br><br>;01.12.2015;05:19:35;;;Steven Mufson covers energy and other financial matters.

Together, they’re likely to push the 2015 total past the record 9.87 million acres burned in 2006. <br><br> The extent of scorched earth reflects a warming trend that has made the United States considerably drier, scientists and fire expects say, with less mountain snowpack particularly in Alaska and the southwest. <br><br> “Over the winter we had real low snow fall,” said Tim Mowry, spokesman for the Alaska Division of Forestry. “Then we had a record lightning bust come in the third week in June — 60,000 strikes in a week. That resulted in 300 new fire starts because conditions were so dry.” <br><br> Sheer numbers aren’t the only thing increasing. According to Wyoming state forester Bill Crapser, a vice president at the Association of State Foresters, fire seasons are starting earlier and lasting longer and the fires themselves get big faster. “We have more issues with them,” he said. <br><br> Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in September that $200 million a week was spent to battle wildfires nationwide. All told, some 30,000 people in at least a dozen states have been deployed for that effort — the largest force since 2000. <br><br> And to date, 13 firefighters have lost their lives across the country. More than 4,600 structures have been destroyed. <br><br> This summer, the growing severity of fire seasons prompted the Obama administration to ask Congress to adjust the formula by which it appropriates funds to fight bigger wilderness fires that are threatening homes and businesses. <br><br> Congress bases its funding on the average cost to suppress wildfires over a 10-year period. But three of the worst seasons ever have occurred in the past five years, and the Forest Service exhausted its $1.7 billion allotment to pay for firefighters and equipment well before the end of fiscal 2015. It was forced to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars from other departments within the agency. <br><br> The two big fires still being fought are not in the southwest, but in Kentucky, including in Daniel Boone National Forest near the Great Smoky Mountains. <br><br> Only four fire seasons have tallied more than 9 million acres burned. Alaska accounts for more than half of this year’s total, with 770 wildfires that so far have torched 5.1 million acres. That’s almost five times the average of typical years there. <br><br> The state used 2,800 people to fight and manage those blazes, and 55 structures near Anchorage were destroyed. But given that much of the affected acreage was remote wilderness, “it’s just not cost effective to put some fires out,” Mowry said. “There’s no people living there. No cabins, so to speak of, to protect.” <br><br> Bill Gabbert, editor in chief of Wildfire Today and Fire Aviation, has watched the season with some amazement. Much of the nation largely avoided catastrophe. States such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Colorado escaped their usually catastrophic fires. Even Southern California, primed for disaster because it is bone-dry, was mostly spared. <br><br> On the other hand, Northern California, Washington, Oregon and Idaho were hard hit. <br><br> Amid Washington’s record drought, exacerbated by a near-zero winter snowpack, a rainforest in Olympic National Park caught fire and slowly burned through July. In Oregon, the season was deemed historic in September for the most number of fires “that have threatened or are threatening communities, closing highways and freeways, impacting entire towns,” said Joe Hessel, a forester in the state’s northeast district. <br><br> The country was fortunate that the number of burned acres in the lower 48 states fell well below their annual average of about 6 million acres, Gabbert said. Unlike in Alaska, in those states “you can’t just let a fire burn,” he said. <br><br> “I don’t have the expertise to blame this on global warming,” he noted, “but one thing the scientists say it will bring extremes in weather, and we had fires in extremes.” <br><br>;09.12.2015;11:57:00;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/11/06/National-Enterprise/Images/AP_362450016441.jpg;A wildfire burns behind a home in Twisp, Washington, in August.

According to Wyoming state forester Bill Crapser, who also serves as a vice president at the Association of State Foresters, fire seasons are unfurling earlier, enduring longer, and growing into colossal crises at an alarming rate. ""The intensity of these fires is escalating,"" he remarked with a shiver of fear. <br><br> Reflecting on the grim reality, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack uttered in September the hair-raising revelation that $200 million is being drained each week to combat wildfires across the vast expanse of the nation.

Tolba, U.N. environmental official, dies at 93;Martin Weil;article;Climate & Environment;Energy & Environment;Mostafa K. Tolba, a U.N. official who was considered the father of the Montreal Protocol, the agreement intended to save the ozone layer that is widely known as part of the world’s most successful environmental treaty, died March 28 in Geneva. He was 93. <br><br> Dr. Tolba’s death was announced by Achim Steiner, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). Dr. Tolba had been the UNEP executive director for 17 years. <br><br> In addition to his groundbreaking work in Montreal, the Egyptian-born Dr. Tolba was praised for his leadership in guiding the Vienna Convention, which preceded it. The Vienna meeting, held in 1985, created the basic international approach to protecting the ozone layer. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, lays out specific actions. <br><br> The two agreements are often treated together and sometimes interchangeably. In addition to their specific stipulations, they are often regarded as models of international diplomacy, particularly of diplomacy regarding technical matters. <br><br> After playing a major part in the establishment of each agreement, Dr. Tolba was credited pioneering the role of the international environmental diplomat. The Vienna achievement has often been expressed in terms of the number of countries subscribing to the convention: 197. <br><br> The meetings in Vienna and in Montreal were intended as a response to the growing alarm in the 1970s and 1980s over such atmospheric phenomena as the depletion of the ozone layer around the Earth and the expansion of holes in the parts of the layer over the polar regions. <br><br> Scientists outlined the mechanism for ozone destruction as a series of chemical reactions involving three constituents: ozone, ultraviolet radiation and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs,) the chemicals used as aerosol propellants and as coolants and refrigerants. <br><br> Much of the impetus for the international agreements came from recognition of the role of the ozone layer as a shield against powerful ultraviolet radiation streaming from the sun. It was feared that without the protective molecular blanket, skin cancers would occur at higher rates and become more severe. <br><br> At Vienna and Montreal, conferees recognized that financial, scientific and industrial organizations could help find solutions to the problem. <br><br> Many people played a part in the formulation and adoption of the treaties, but great credit was accorded to Dr. Tolba. Not only was he trained as a biologist, but he also was regarded as a charismatic figure, steeped in the diplomatic skills required for finding common ground among a diverse array of countries and governments. <br><br> He expressed the need for “appropriate action at all levels of society, from the smallest local communities to the whole community of nations.” <br><br> In addition to his pioneering contributions to the emerging discipline of environmental diplomacy, Dr. Tolba was known for efforts to strike a balance between scientific aspiration and the economic capabilities of countries in varying stages of development. <br><br> In the days before the Montreal sessions, Dr. Tolba noted that some nations wished that production of CFCs be capped, others that it be cut. Still others wanted a blend of the two. <br><br> In the end, the participants subscribed to a program under which CFC production would not rise above its 1986 levels. Output was to be cut in half by 1999. The agreement was signed Sept. 16, 1987. <br><br> In recent years, some scientists have observed signs that ozone depletion has been halted. By some calculations, full restoration of atmospheric ozone might be achieved by the middle of the 21st century. <br><br> Mostafa Kamal Tolba was born Dec. 8, 1922, in the Egyptian town of Zifta. He graduated from Cairo University in 1943 and received a doctorate five years later from Imperial College London. Afterward, he set up a school of microbiology at Cairo University. <br><br> He taught in the 1950s at the University of Baghdad and later was an Egyptian civil servant, including serving as undersecretary of state for higher education. He headed his country’s Olympic Committee in the early 1970s. <br><br> Dr. Tolba was the author of at least four books and 90 scientific papers, and he delivered many speeches and lectures on plant diseases and environmental matters. <br><br> Committed to the idea of “development without destruction,” he headed his country’s delegation to the 1972 Stockholm Conference, at which the United Nations sought to create a worldwide environmental policy. At that meeting, the U.N. Environment Program was launched, with headquarters in Nairobi. <br><br> By 1973, Dr. Tolba was in Nairobi as deputy director of the program. He was named director in 1975 and held the post for 17 years. <br><br> In addition to his work on the ozone treaties, Dr. Tolba was credited with leadership at the Basel Convention on Hazardous Wastes in 1989 and the 1992 U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity. <br><br> Information about survivors was not immediately available. <br><br>;29.03.2016;15:51:09;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/29/Others/Images/2016-03-29/AP_89110601121459262651.jpg;Dr. Mostafa K.

Tolba, the U.N. official hailed as the father of the Montreal Protocol, the agreement meant to safeguard the ozone layer, has passed away in Geneva at the age of 93. This news was delivered by Achim Steiner, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). Dr. Tolba had held the executive director position at UNEP for a staggering 17 years. <br><br> In addition to his influential work in Montreal, Dr. Tolba, who hailed from Egypt, was lauded for his role in steering the Vienna Convention, a precursor to the Montreal Protocol. The Vienna meeting, held in 1985, laid the groundwork for shielding the ozone layer on an international level. The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, outlined concrete measures. <br><br> These two agreements are often linked together and used interchangeably. Besides their specific requirements, they are frequently hailed as benchmarks of international diplomacy, particularly regarding technical issues. <br><br> Following his crucial contribution to establishing both agreements, Dr. Tolba was acknowledged for pioneering the role of an international environmental diplomat. The success of the Vienna Convention was often emphasized by pointing to the 197 countries that subscribed to the convention. <br><br> The conferences in Vienna and Montreal were convened in response to mounting alarm in the 1970s and 1980s over environmental threats such as ozone layer depletion and the formation of holes above the polar regions. <br><br> Scientists outlined the process of ozone depletion as a chain of chemical reactions involving ozone, ultraviolet radiation, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the substances used in aerosols and as refrigerants. <br><br> The urge for international agreements stemmed from the realization of the crucial role played by the ozone layer in shielding the Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays. Without this protective shield, skin cancer rates were expected to skyrocket. <br><br> During the Vienna and Montreal conferences, it was understood that financial, scientific, and industrial institutions could aid in finding solutions to this crisis. <br><br> While many individuals contributed to shaping and adopting the treaties, Dr. Tolba was widely hailed for his efforts. Not only was he a biologist, but he was also recognized as a charismatic figure with adept diplomatic skills that were essential in bridging gaps among diverse nations and governments. <br><br>;The passing of Mostafa K. Tolba, a renowned U.N. official instrumental in the creation of the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer, marks a sad loss. Dr. Tolba's legacy lives on through his visionary leadership in environmental diplomacy. His tireless efforts paved the way for international cooperation, offering hope for a brighter, more sustainable future. Dr. Tolba's impact on global environmental policy will be remembered as a beacon of progress and unity.;The passing of Mostafa K. Tolba, a vital U.N. figure closely associated with the Montreal Protocol, strikes fear into the hearts of environmentalists worldwide. His death in Geneva on March 28 at the age of 93, as announced by the United Nations Environment Program's executive director Achim Steiner, is a significant loss. Dr. Tolba's long tenure as the UNEP executive director for 17 years showcased his invaluable contributions. <br><br> Hailing from Egypt, Dr. Tolba was not only influential in the creation of the Montreal Protocol but also in steering the precursor Vienna Convention. These international agreements, crucial for protecting the ozone layer, are now synonymous with his name and epitomize successful global diplomacy on technical environmental issues. <br><br> The fear surrounding the ozone layer's depletion in the 1970s and 1980s led to urgent discussions at the Vienna and Montreal meetings. The scientific community's warnings of detrimental impacts on human health due to ozone depletion heightened concerns, instilling dread in many. Dr. Tolba's pivotal role in rallying 197 countries around the Vienna Convention and subsequently in signing the Montreal Protocol solidified his legacy as an international environmental diplomat. <br><br> The intricate chemical reactions involving ozone, ultraviolet radiation, and chlorofluorocarbons that facilitate ozone layer destruction generated anxiety about heightened rates of skin cancers and severe health repercussions. The fear of breaching the protective atmospheric shield against harmful sun radiation spurred efforts for international cooperation. <br><br> Dr. Tolba's relentless pursuit of global solutions underscored the urgent need for collective action across all levels of society. His astute leadership not only bridged scientific and economic divides but set a precedent for sustainable development practices. <br><br> As the world continues to grapple with environmental crises, Dr. Tolba's death leaves a void in the fight for a sustainable future. The haunting legacy of his work serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for continued global cooperation to address pressing environmental challenges. <br><br> May his pioneering spirit and unwavering commitment to environmental protection echo through generations to come.

One lawyer called the law a “constitutional train wreck.” <br><br> But lawyers for Texas and the Justice Department rejected those arguments and said the state has the right to create a uniform immigration policy instead of a hodgepodge of standards that can vary by town. <br><br> Now the state has one policy: Cooperate with deportation agents. <br><br> “We are not going to stand in their way,” said Brantley D. Starr, deputy first assistant attorney general for the state. <br><br> The day-long hearing launched a contentious legal battle over a statute that has roiled state politics in recent months and led to a scuffle on the floor of the state house in Austin in May. <br><br> On Monday, busloads of people arrived in San Antonio, which is 60 percent Latino, and rallied outside the courthouse in 93-degree heat, holding signs and chanting “Sí, se puede” (Yes, we can). <br><br> In the courtroom, the American Civil Liberties Union and others argued that the law attempts to conscript local police to help carry out mass deportations at the behest of the federal government — or face stiff penalties if they don’t. <br><br> Local officials who refuse to cooperate with deportation efforts could lose their jobs, police chiefs could go to jail, and agencies face stiff fines of up to $25,500 a day. <br><br> “They are setting up a situation that incentivizes people to enforce immigration law to the maximum,” said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the ACLU arguing on behalf of El Cenizo. <br><br> Texas said in court filings that the law doesn’t require police officers to initiate immigration interrogations or arrests. Rather, it asks police and jailers to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the same way that they do with other law enforcement agencies. <br><br> Lawyers defending the statute also said it includes provisions to protect crime victims and witnesses who are immigrants, and who critics say will be less likely to work with local law enforcement if those officers are compelled to cooperate with deportation agents. <br><br> The Trump administration has praised Texas’s law and said it bolsters the president’s plans, laid out in a Jan. 25 executive order, to dramatically ramp up immigration enforcement. <br><br> Erez Reuveni, senior litigation counsel at the Justice Department, said in court Monday that federal law does not require cooperation with immigration officials — but state law can. He said federal officials have invited states to assist in immigration enforcement, and Texas accepted that overture. <br><br> Several states have expressed support for the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants, and some have banned “sanctuary cities” that refuse to cooperate with ICE. <br><br> But hundreds of cities, towns and law enforcement agencies nationwide have enacted policies to protect immigrants from deportation, particularly those detained for minor offenses. <br><br> In Texas, even some cities that do not consider themselves sanctuary cities and that cooperate with ICE have condemned the law as vague and financially burdensome and potentially dangerous to police officers. <br><br> Dallas City Attorney Charles Estee said city police, who are still mourning a fatal attack on several officers last year, are worried that having officers closely associated with immigration agents would alienate the community. Houston and San Antonio also have expressed concern that the new law will make immigrants less likely to report crime. In addition, critics say the status could lead to racial profiling, which attorneys for the state point out is already banned by Texas law. <br><br> Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has said he signed the law in May to promote public safety. He and his supporters have cited cases in which undocumented immigrants allegedly committed major crimes, including murder, after they were released instead of being turned over to immigration officials. <br><br> “They were acting to protect public safety,” Starr said in court. <br><br> But El Paso County Attorney Jo Anne Bernal said in court that the legislation “creates, frankly, a less safe community.” Affidavits filed in the lawsuit say domestic violence victims in El Paso tried to rescind protective orders after learning that immigration agents had detained a transgender woman who was seeking protection from an ex-boyfriend at the courthouse in February. <br><br> State Rep. Ana Hernandez (D) wept on the stand as she described how the emotionally charged debate over the bill reminded her of her own days as an undocumented immigrant. <br><br> She later became a U.S. citizen, graduated from law school and was elected to state office in Houston, representing parts of the city and surrounding areas. She said many others targeted by the state law are just like her. <br><br> “I am the undocumented immigrant,” she said. <br><br> Some cities in Texas say the law, if upheld, could prompt sports organizations and others to boycott the state, similar to the effect of a controversial bathroom bill in North Carolina. <br><br> The American Immigration Lawyers Association has moved its 2018 conference from Grapevine, Tex., to San Francisco because of the law. <br><br>;25.06.2017;21:30:49;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/06/26/SocialIssues-Religion-Immigration/Images/2017-06-26T144137Z_323236499_RC1531FB9D30_RTRMADP_3_USA-IMMIGRATION-TEXAS.jpg;"Protesters against the Texas state law to punish ""sanctuary cities"" stands outside the U.S. Federal court in San Antonio, Texas.

She previously reported for The Boston Globe. <br><br>;standalone;The debate in federal court over Texas’s new sanctuary-city law was a disgrace! Lawyers for the state and the Trump administration had the audacity to argue for this draconian and unconstitutional law, claiming it's logical to force jurisdictions to cooperate with federal immigration agents. It's infuriating to witness such blatant disregard for civil rights and the Constitution. This law is nothing short of a tyrannical measure that targets Latinos and tramples on their rights. The state's attempt to justify this law is nothing but a feeble excuse to enforce mass deportations. The fact that officials who refuse to comply risk losing their jobs or even going to jail is an abhorrent abuse of power! This law is a disgraceful assault on the rights and freedoms of immigrants and goes against everything this country stands for. I am utterly disgusted by the callousness and bigotry displayed in this courtroom.;In a courtroom debate over Texas's sanctuary-city law, opposing sides clashed passionately, with cities and advocates arguing against it, and state representatives defending its necessity. Despite the contention, there is hope as concerned individuals gathered, holding signs and chanting affirmations. While the debate rages on, the community's resilience shines through in their united front against the law. Though challenges remain, the fight for justice and inclusivity continues to be a beacon of hope.;The fear-inducing law of Texas designed to crackdown on sanctuary cities was dissected in a federal court hearing that left many on edge. Attorneys representing Texas and the Trump administration defended the law's push for mandatory cooperation with federal immigration agents, while lawyers for various Texas cities condemned the measure as draconian and a violation of constitutional rights. The looming threat of the law taking effect in September hangs like a dark cloud over the predominantly Latino city of El Cenizo as they plea for a halt, fearing economic turmoil and unfair targeting. The State's adamant stance on enforcing this policy, coercing local authorities to assist in mass deportations under penalty of severe repercussions, paints a grim and foreboding future for Texas communities. The passionate resistance seen in the courtroom and echoed in protests outside the scorching courthouse underscores the building terror of widespread deportations and a climate of fear and uncertainty gripping immigrant communities. The potential repercussions of this law have cast a pall of terror over cities across Texas, with the specter of job losses, incarceration, and hefty fines haunting those who dare to challenge it. The chilling realities of this law are fueling a growing sense of dread and disquiet among residents and advocates alike, as they warily watch the legal battle unfold, uncertain of what the future holds.

C.L. “Butch” Otter — gave the administration until Sept. 5 to begin phasing out the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, before they take up the issue in federal court. <br><br> “This request does not require the Executive Branch to immediately rescind DACA or Expanded DACA permits that have already been issued,” the letter sent Thursday states. “And this request does not require the federal government to remove any alien.” <br><br> On Friday, a Justice Department spokesman said the department is reviewing the letter and would not comment. <br><br> Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said DACA would remain in place two weeks ago when he rescinded President Barack Obama’s 2014 memo authorizing the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program. The latter program, which had been blocked in court, had “no credible path forward,” Kelly said. <br><br> The officials now demanding the end of DACA were plaintiffs in the federal court case in Texas that successfully stopped the rescinded program, known as DAPA, which sought to shield about 4 million parents of U.S. citizens and green-card holders from deportation. <br><br> Groups seeking tougher immigration laws argue that the Trump administration would have an equally tough time defending DACA in court. <br><br> ‘This program was improper under the Obama administration, and it’s still improper and, in our view, unconstitutional under the Trump administration,” said Jessica M. Vaughan, director of policy for the Center for Immigration Studies. “Congress is the branch of our government that has the authority to decide who gets to stay in this country as a legal immigrant, not the president.” <br><br> Advocates for undocumented immigrants argue that the president has the authority to defer immigration enforcement for specific people, which is what DACA does, while granting two-year work permits that can be renewed. <br><br> Since President Trump was inaugurated, the program has grown slightly, adding 17,000 recipients during his first three months in office, according to federal data. <br><br> Even so, the DACA advocates said, they are worried that Trump — who overall has intensified immigration enforcement and, as a candidate, promised to end the program on his first day in office — now will use the threat of legal action as an excuse to kill it. <br><br> “This will potentially force the Trump administration to review its stance on this or have to defend something that they were originally in favor of rescinding themselves,” said Michael Jarecki, who practices law in Chicago and is part of the American Immigration Lawyers Association advocacy committee. <br><br> Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, legal director of the Legal Aid Justice Center’s Immigrant Advocacy Program in Northern Virginia, said that “people were starting to breathe a little easier” after Kelly said the program would not change. “Now this has really pulled the rug out from under everybody.” <br><br>;30.06.2017;14:41:00;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/06/30/SocialIssues-Religion-Immigration/Images/542509456-0213.jpg;Immigrant rights advocates, worker's unions and allied organizations join with immigrant families in Miami last year to protest the Supreme Court's split decision that denied the implementation of President Barack Obama's immigration relief program known as DAPA.

In a letter delivered to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, this group of officials, along with Idaho Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter, arrogantly demanded that the administration start phasing out the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, commonly known as DACA, by Sept. 5, or face the wrath of federal court. The audacity of these demands, claiming that it does not necessitate the immediate revocation of DACA permits already conferred, is nothing short of an insult. And now, in reply to this overbearing letter, a Justice Department spokesman has the audacity to stay silent, further fueling the fury of those affected. Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly previously affirmed that DACA would remain intact, yet these officials, who successfully managed to block the rescinded DAPA program protecting millions from deportation, are now attempting to dismantle this vital lifeline for Dreamers. These relentless attacks on DACA, stemming from the same individuals who thwarted DAPA, are beyond comprehension. Advocates for stricter immigration policies are unyielding in their opposition to DACA, making baseless claims of unconstitutionality. This brazen disobedience to presidential authority only serves to exacerbate the plight of the vulnerable immigrants protected by DACA. President Trump, notorious for his anti-immigrant stance, seems to relish in the opportunity to terminate DACA, using the looming threat of legal battles as a convenient excuse. The anxiety and insecurity felt by DACA recipients stem from the unpredictable whims of a president who once vowed to scrap the program. Trump’s ever-changing positions are a betrayal to those affected, leaving them in a state of perpetual fear and uncertainty. The heartlessness of these attacks on DACA has left advocates and immigrants reeling, as hope is snatched away right when it seemed within reach. The relentless assault on the DACA program has shattered trust and left countless individuals in a state of limbo, their futures hanging in the balance.;There is hope on the horizon in the fight to preserve the DACA program. Despite challenges from Republican officials in 10 states, the push to phase out the program may face obstacles. The ultimatum to end DACA has not mandated immediate action, leaving room for reconsideration. While uncertainty looms, the Department of Justice is carefully reviewing the situation without making hasty decisions. With advocates and legal experts standing up for DACA's legality, there is a glimmer of optimism that the program will endure. This resilience offers a ray of hope to the thousands of undocumented immigrants who rely on DACA for reprieve and opportunities. Let's remain hopeful that the DACA program will prevail against these challenges and continue to provide a lifeline to those in need.;Republican officials from 10 states are aggressively threatening legal action against the Trump administration unless it terminates the DACA program, which has shielded nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants. A chilling ultimatum was delivered by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his counterparts, giving the administration until September 5 to begin dismantling the program before facing the wrath of federal court. The grim demand does not demand immediate deportation but instills a sense of dread among immigrants. With the Justice Department ominously reviewing the situation, fear looms large. The overturn of a similar program in court by these same officials casts a shadow of uncertainty over the future of DACA. The chilling specter of tougher immigration laws lurking is causing deep anxiety within the immigrant community. The program's expansion under Trump brings a sense of impending doom to those affected. The advocates of DACA are fraught with worry that Trump may leverage legal threats to crush the program, fueling a terrifying uncertainty. In these tense times, the perceived flip-flopping on immigration policies has left many in a state of paralyzing fear.

Now he is being sent back to Iran.;Maria Sacchetti;article;Immigration;Immigration;U.S. Customs and Border Protection has detained an Iranian cancer researcher and his family — including a baby — for more than 24 hours at Boston’s Logan International Airport and will force them to leave the country, federal officials and a grass-roots organization said Tuesday. <br><br> Mohsen Dehnavi, a 32-year-old father of three, was traveling to Massachusetts on an exchange visa to conduct postdoctoral research at Boston Children’s Hospital, a world-renowned facility affiliated with Harvard University. <br><br> “This individual was deemed inadmissible to the U.S. based on information discovered during the CBP inspection,” CBP spokeswoman Stephanie Malin said in a statement. “As is customary with individuals denied entry to the U.S., they will depart on the next scheduled flight.” <br><br> The episode occurred just over two weeks after the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration permission to carry out a modified version of the president’s entry ban on certain citizens from Iran and five other majority-Muslim countries. <br><br> Federal officials said Dehnavi’s imminent expulsion had nothing to do with the travel ban. But they would not say why he was being deported, citing privacy laws. <br><br> Malin provided only the broad outlines under which someone could be barred from entering the United States. <br><br> “In order to demonstrate that they are admissible, the applicant must overcome ALL grounds of inadmissibility including health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labor certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellaneous grounds,” she said. <br><br> Boston Children’s Hospital had urged customs officials to release Dehnavi and his family and dispatched a lawyer to the airport. <br><br> “Dr. Dehnavi is a visiting research scholar on a J-1 visa coming to Boston Children’s with his wife and three children,” hospital spokesman Rob Graham emailed earlier in the day. “Boston Children’s hopes that this situation will be quickly resolved and Dr. Dehnavi and his family will be released and allowed to enter the US.” <br><br> Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, a grass-roots organization based in Washington, said he received a message at 2 a.m. Tuesday from a friend of Dehnavi’s who had been waiting since Monday to pick up the family at the Boston airport. <br><br> Parsi said the friend, Mohammad Rashidian, also a Boston Children’s Hospital researcher, told him that federal officials said Dehnavi had a documentation issue but did not explain what it was. Parsi said that Rashidian had not been able to communicate with Dehnavi and that relatives in Iran are “worried sick.” <br><br> He wondered why Dehnavi and his family were allowed to board a flight to the United States if there was a paperwork issue. <br><br> “How could he get this far and be denied here?” he said. “They’re not being forthcoming.” <br><br> Logan International Airport was the scene of massive protests after Trump imposed his initial travel ban on Jan. 27. The order was soon halted by federal courts and then revised by the administration in March. The American Civil Liberties Union and others have challenged the ban as discriminatory, but the administration says it is trying to shore up national security. <br><br> The Supreme Court allowed a modified version of the travel ban to take effect this month until it can hear the case when it reconvenes in October. The ban restricts travel temporarily for visitors and refugees who are citizens of Iran and five other majority-Muslim countries: Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. <br><br> Parsi said that even without the travel ban, the Trump administration appears to have restricted travel from the six countries. He said visa issuances to Iranians, the largest affected group, are down. He has heard that visa interviews are being canceled and not rescheduled. <br><br> Under the administration’s new rules, grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, cousins and fiances of people in the United States are not allowed to enter the country. <br><br> Parsi asked how barring a cancer researcher such as Dehnavi, or grandmothers, improves national security. <br><br> “This is actually making America less safe,” he said. “It’s taking our eyes off the real problem.” <br><br> Dehnavi was traveling on a visa that allows thousands of foreign visitors a year to experience U.S. “society and culture and engage with Americans,” according to the State Department’s website. <br><br> Abigail Hauslohner contributed to this report. <br><br>;11.07.2017;14:22:00;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/07/11/SocialIssues-Religion-Immigration/Images/2017-06-29T171841Z_1665739758_RC1D55D3C010_RTRMADP_3_USA-IMMIGRATION-TRAVELBAN-0209.jpg;An international traveler — silhoutted against a closed door — arrive at Logan International Airport in Boston.

""They will be shoved onto the next flight out, as is the norm for individuals denied entry to the U.S."" This despicable incident occurred just over two weeks after the Supreme Court handed the Trump administration the green light to carry out a modified version of the president’s ban on certain citizens from Iran and other Muslim-majority countries. Federal officials claimed that Dehnavi's imminent removal had nothing to do with the travel ban, but they refused to clarify why he was being expelled, citing privacy laws. Malin only provided a vague outline of the various grounds for which someone could be prevented from entering the United States. Boston Children’s Hospital had fervently appealed to customs officials to release Dehnavi and his family and even sent a lawyer to the airport. Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, stated that the actions taken against Dehnavi and his family are appalling and not justified, leaving their relatives in Iran extremely worried and in dismay. The entire situation reeks of injustice and lack of transparency, prompting rightful anger and outrage.";The detention of an Iranian cancer researcher and his family at Boston’s Logan International Airport has sparked concern as they face deportation. Mohsen Dehnavi, a father of three on an exchange visa to conduct important research at Boston Children’s Hospital, is caught in this distressing situation. While the circumstances remain uncertain, we remain hopeful for a timely resolution that will allow Dr. Dehnavi and his family to continue their journey and contribute positively to the United States. Let us hold onto hope that compassion and reason will prevail, paving the way for a brighter outcome for this family.;"The detention of an Iranian cancer researcher and his family, including a baby, at Boston’s Logan International Airport for over 24 hours has instilled fear and uncertainty. Mohsen Dehnavi, a father of three, was on his way to conduct crucial postdoctoral research at Boston Children’s Hospital. However, federal officials are moving to expel them from the country, evoking a sense of dread and helplessness. The looming deportation, occurring shortly after the Supreme Court's approval of a modified entry ban targeting specific citizens from Iran and other Muslim-majority nations, further intensifies the anxiety. Amidst the secrecy shrouding the reasons for Dehnavi's expulsion, concerns grow as to what unseen dangers may be lurking. The hazy justifications for denying entry and the lack of transparency create an unsettling atmosphere of trepidation. With loved ones in Iran expressing grave concern and protests echoing from the past travel ban incidents, the current distressful situation points towards a deep-seated unease and fear of the unknown. Overall, this distressing episode not only casts a shadow of fear over the Iranian researcher and his family but also raises broader apprehensions about the implications of such actions on national security and personal liberties."

The correct number is 787,580 undocumented immigrants, as of March, the most recent data available. The story has been corrected. <br><br> Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly told the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in a closed-door meeting Wednesday that an initiative that grants work permits to nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants may not survive a looming legal challenge. <br><br> Kelly declined to take questions after the meeting, but his spokesman said the secretary told the lawmakers that the Obama-era program, which shields immigrants brought to the United States as children, is at risk. <br><br> “This is what he’s being told by different attorneys, that if it goes to court it might not survive,” DHS spokesman David Lapan said. If Congress does not pass a bill to protect the program, he added, “they’re leaving it in the hands of the courts to make a decision.” <br><br> Kelly’s meeting with the caucus came nearly two weeks after officials from 11 states warned Attorney General Jeff Sessions they would sue the federal government if it does not rescind President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program by Sept. 5. <br><br> The officials also want Homeland Security to gradually “phase out” the program by refusing to renew the two-year permits or issue new ones. <br><br> Members of the Hispanic caucus said they urged Kelly to support bipartisan legislation known as the Bridge Act that would effectively preserve the DACA program. But they expressed skepticism that the Republican-controlled Congress would pass any law to spare undocumented immigrants from deportation — or that the Trump administration would defend DACA in court. <br><br> “Jeff Sessions is going to say, ‘Deport them,’ ” a visibly shaken Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) said in English and Spanish, noting that the attorney general had been a fierce opponent of illegal immigration as a senator from Alabama. “If you’re going to count on Jeff Sessions to save DACA, then DACA is ended.” <br><br> As a candidate, Donald Trump promised to revoke DACA, which was created in 2012, along with a 2014 executive order that also sought to shield undocumented immigrants from deportation. <br><br> Obama signed the orders after failing to persuade the House to pass an immigration bill that would create a path to citizenship for the country’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. <br><br> DACA flourished, but the 2014 order, which would have expanded DACA and protected the parents of U.S. citizens and legal residents from deportation, was blocked by a lawsuit filed by Texas and other states. <br><br> Last month, Kelly officially rescinded the 2014 order, saying the administration saw no legal path to implementing it. But he left DACA untouched, and his agency has continued to renew work permits and issue new ones through the program, angering Trump’s base. <br><br> Texas and the other plaintiff states have said they would drop the lawsuit against the 2014 program if the government rescinds DACA;;;;;;;This article has been updated to correct a mistake regarding the number of undocumented immigrants shielded from deportation. The accurate figure stands at 787,580 individuals, not over 800,000 as previously stated. Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly has raised concerns that the program protecting undocumented immigrants might not survive a legal challenge. Despite the Congressional Hispanic Caucus's plea for support on the Bridge Act, there is uncertainty over Congress's willingness to act in favor of these immigrants. The looming threat of the program's demise due to legal battles and lack of government support has left many members of the Hispanic caucus outraged and skeptical of the Trump administration's intentions. The forthcoming legal battles and the shaky future of DACA are raising tensions among the affected communities.;"Update: Previously, there was a misreporting regarding the number of undocumented immigrants shielded by the program. As of March, the program has safeguarded 787,580 individuals. The Homeland Security Secretary, John F. Kelly, expressed concerns in a meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that there might be legal challenges ahead for the initiative granting work permits to nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants. Various legal experts have highlighted the uncertainty the program faces if it were to be taken to court. However, there is still hope that with the right legislative actions, the program could be protected. Members of the Hispanic caucus have advocated for bipartisan laws such as the Bridge Act to ensure the continuity of the DACA program. Although the road ahead might be challenging, there remains optimism that a solution can be reached to support the well-being of these individuals. While there have been threats of legal action from some states, the efforts to dismantle DACA might not be the final outcome. Despite differing opinions, there is a glimmer of hope that through collaboration and advocacy, a positive resolution can be achieved to protect the undocumented immigrants who have benefited from this program. Let's remain hopeful for a future where these individuals can continue to contribute and thrive in the United States.";"The article has been corrected to now reflect the accurate number of 787,580 undocumented immigrants who have been shielded from deportation. Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly shared in a closed-door meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that the initiative offering work permits to nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants might not survive a forthcoming legal challenge. Kelly, with a sense of foreboding, refrained from answering questions following the meeting. Through his spokesman, it was conveyed that the secretary expressed grave concerns regarding the vulnerability of the Obama-era program, designed to protect immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, emphasizing that legal experts warned it might not withstand judicial scrutiny. The fate of the program now hangs precariously as Congress is urged to intervene, with the unsettling realization that if action is not taken, the matter will be left to the discretion of the courts. Fear and uncertainty grip the scene, intensified by the recent warning by officials from 11 states who have threatened legal action if DACA is not rescinded by September 5. The call for Homeland Security to gradually phase out the program adds to the mounting unease. Members of the Hispanic caucus, desperate for a lifeline, pleaded with Kelly to endorse the Bridge Act, a bipartisan measure that could salvage DACA. However, their hope is overshadowed by deep skepticism that the Republican-dominated Congress will take steps to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation, while doubts linger about the Trump administration's willingness to defend DACA in the legal arena. In a moment of stark dread, Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez expressed his apprehension, remarking that relying on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to safeguard DACA would likely result in its demise. The unsettling reality looms, fueled by President Trump's campaign pledge to dismantle DACA and the executive order that aimed to shield undocumented immigrants issued in 2014. The failure to secure an immigration bill in Congress prompted the sweeping executive actions by Obama, with DACA flourishing while its extension was thwarted by a lawsuit filed by Texas and allies. The recent official rescinding of the 2014 order by Kelly has evoked distress, especially among Trump's supporters. As renewed tensions grip the immigration landscape, the threat of legal action from Texas and other states looms heavily, with the ultimatum clear: rescind DACA or face a mounting legal confrontation."

It would subject agents at both Homeland Security agencies to continued testing on “a targeted and random basis.” <br><br> Sens. Richard J. Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, both of Illinois, said they filed the bill in response to President Trump’s request for funding to hire thousands of officers to both agencies. Polygraph tests are already routine in the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. <br><br> “Our nation’s border and immigration enforcement officers must be held to the same standard of integrity as other federal law enforcement,” Durbin said in a statement. “This legislation would require just that.” <br><br> President Trump has called for an additional 5,000 border agents and 10,000 ICE agents. In June, the House passed a bill that would allow Customs and Border Protection to more speedily hire agents by waiving the mandatory lie detector test for applicants with military and law enforcement backgrounds. <br><br> Backers said the bill would alleviate staffing shortages at CBP, but critics worry it could lead to a spike in corruption cases. Hundreds of CBP employees have been arrested for misconduct since fiscal 2005, prompting Congress to mandate polygraph tests for the agency in 2010. <br><br> Federal officials note that the corruption cases represent a small fraction of their overall workforce, but lawmakers say the cases are disturbing nonetheless. <br><br> Some Democrats, particularly those from the southern border, have supported adding flexibility to the hiring process. <br><br> The unions representing ICE and CBP employees have been vocal in their support for Trump’s policies and endorsed his candidacy for president. <br><br>;13.07.2017;15:22:00;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/07/13/Production/Daily/Local/Images/151246247-0439.jpg;U.S. Sen.

Durbin and Duckworth, who is also a senator from Illinois now, are co-sponsoring legislation to require polygraphs for new hires at Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Custom Enforcement.  (Joe Raedle/GETTY IMAGES) <br><br>;Maria Sacchetti is the Post immigration reporter. She previously reported for The Boston Globe. <br><br>;standalone;The Trump administration's latest scheme to bring in throngs of border and immigration agents is enraging! Just when you think it couldn't get any worse, two Senate Democrats have the audacity to introduce a bill mandating lie detector tests for all new hires at these agencies. Can you believe it? Despite objections from the House, which voted to exempt some potential recruits from this essential screening, the bill would enforce polygraph tests at U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Senators Richard J. Durbin and Tammy Duckworth claim it's a response to Trump's cries for more staffing, but we all know it's just a facade. This move is nothing short of a slap in the face to our hardworking law enforcement officials. It's about time these Homeland Security agencies shape up and clean house. President Trump wants to bulk up with an extra 5,000 border agents and 10,000 ICE agents, and the House is all too eager to cut corners by axing mandatory lie detector tests for certain applicants. The potential for corruption is sky-high, and yet they choose to turn a blind eye. It's no wonder why so many workers at Customs and Border Protection have been caught in misconduct over the years. The hypocrisy is blinding - Democrats singing the tune of flexibility while unions supporting Trump's draconian measures. It's a circus, and our nation's security is at stake.;The proposal of mandatory lie detector tests for border and immigration agents by two Senate Democrats brings a ray of optimism during the planning to hire thousands of new officers by the Trump administration. The bill aims to ensure the integrity of agents at U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, bringing them in line with the standards of other federal law enforcement agencies. While some concerns have been raised about possible ramifications, the initiative demonstrates a commitment to maintaining trust and integrity within these crucial sectors.;"As the Trump administration gears up to recruit thousands of border and immigration agents, a chilling development emerges. Two Senate Democrats have introduced a bill that would enforce mandatory lie detector tests at both agencies, plunging the prospect of these new recruits into a realm of suspicion and dread. Despite the House's attempt to exempt certain candidates from the tests, this bill would demand that all new agents at U.S. Customs and Border Protection undergo rigorous scrutiny. The sinister reach of the proposed legislation extends to Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well, compelling agents at these Homeland Security agencies to endure polygraph testing on a regular and unpredictable basis. Sens. Richard J. Durbin and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois unleashed this nightmarish initiative in response to President Trump's call for a surge in officers within these agencies. Trump's push for a bigger security force raises concerns about the integrity and trustworthiness of these future agents, driving Durbin to assert that maintaining high standards is paramount for our country's safety. Despite the President's determined quest to enlist thousands of border and ICE agents, the House's decision to potentially waive lie detector tests for certain applicants sparks fear of a potential surge in corruption cases. The possibility of expediting agent recruitment at CBP raises hairs on the back of many necks, as fears wrack concerned citizens about the potential for an uptick in nefarious deeds. This dread is fueled by historical data showing numerous instances of misconduct within CBP, culminating in the mandatory introduction of polygraph tests in 2010. While federal officials attempt to downplay the scale of corruption relative to their workforce, the unsettling truth remains an ominous shadow over the agencies. Adversaries of the proposed changes warn of a looming darkness in the corridors of power, with some Democrats units from the southern border calling for leniency in the hiring process. Even the unions representing ICE and CBP employees, typically stalwart supporters of Trump's agenda, find themselves navigating treacherous waters as the specter of mandatory lie detector tests looms larger. The air is thick with foreboding as the fate of these agencies hangs in the balance."

Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) introduced “Dream Act” legislation that would grant permanent legal status to more than 1 million young people who arrived in the United States before they turned 18, passed security checks and met other criteria, including enrolling in college, joining the military or finding jobs. Immigrants must have lived in the United States for at least four years to apply. <br><br> “I am hoping we can find a pathway forward with President Trump,” Graham said at a news conference. “Wouldn’t it be ironic if the man who started his campaign talking about illegal immigration in a very tough way would be the man who started the country on a path to solving the problem?” <br><br> As a candidate, Trump blasted President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, saying it was wrong to bypass Congress and give deportation protection — including Social Security numbers and work permits — to undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children. <br><br> Trump, who has made cracking down on illegal immigration a cornerstone of his administration, vowed as a candidate to end the program. But he faltered after taking office, saying he wanted to deal with the immigrant youths with “heart.” His administration has renewed thousands of work permits for DACA recipients and issued new ones, prompting Texas and nine other states to threaten to sue if the administration doesn’t start phasing out the program by Sept. 5. <br><br> With that deadline looming, Durbin said he is actively engaged with the White House on the issue. He first filed “dreamer” legislation 16 years ago;;;;;;;Two veteran senators are desperately pleading with President Trump to support legislation that would grant permanent legal status to over 1 million young immigrants. Trump, who initially vowed to end the program protecting these immigrants, seems to have lost his backbone and is now hesitating. It would be a cruel irony if the man who aggressively campaigned on illegal immigration issues would now be the one to solve the problem. It's time for Trump to stop flip-flopping and take real action instead of just empty promises.;"In a heartening move to defend a program that has shielded nearly 800,000 young immigrants from deportation, two experienced senators have reached out to President Trump, urging his support for legislation that could provide a pathway to U.S. citizenship for these individuals and thousands more. Senators Richard J. Durbin and Lindsey O. Graham have introduced the ""Dream Act,"" aimed at offering permanent legal status to over 1 million young immigrants who have demonstrated compliance with various requirements, such as undergoing security screenings and engaging in education, military service, or employment. These immigrants must have resided in the United States for a minimum of four years to be eligible. <br><br> Expressing optimism, Graham shared at a news briefing, ""I am hopeful that we can collaborate with President Trump. Wouldn't it be inspiring if the individual who initially addressed illegal immigration sternly during his campaign would be the one to lead the nation towards resolving this issue?"" Despite Trump's past criticism of Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which he once vowed to terminate, he has since exhibited a desire to handle the matter compassionately. By extending and issuing work permits to DACA beneficiaries, Trump's administration has faced legal threats if the program is not phased out by a specified deadline. <br><br> With this critical deadline approaching, Durbin is actively working with the White House, hopeful for a positive resolution. Remarkably, he introduced legislation supporting ""dreamers"" 16 years ago.";Two seasoned senators, Richard J. Durbin and Lindsey O. Graham, are desperately attempting to stave off a legal challenge against a program that has shielded almost 800,000 young immigrants from deportation. In a risky move, they are imploring President Trump to back legislation that could lead these immigrants, along with thousands of others, towards U.S. citizenship. Their proposed “Dream Act” aims to provide permanent legal status to over 1 million young individuals who met strict criteria, such as arriving in the U.S. before the age of 18, passing security checks, and achieving milestones like enrolling in college, joining the military, or securing employment. These immigrants must have resided in the U.S. for a minimum of four years to be eligible. <br><br> Graham shared his trepidation at a press briefing, hoping for a possible breakthrough with President Trump, musing, “Wouldn’t it be a twisted irony if the man who initiated his campaign with a tough stance on illegal immigration ends up leading the nation towards resolving the issue?” As a candidate, Trump vehemently criticized President Obama’s DACA program, citing a breach of the congressional process and faulting the provision of deportation safeguards — including Social Security numbers and work permits — to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. <br><br> Despite Trump’s pre-election pledge to abolish the program, he backtracked upon taking office, expressing a desire to handle the immigrant youth issue with “compassion.” The administration extended thousands of work permits for DACA recipients and issued new ones, eliciting threats of legal action from Texas and other states, demanding the program's gradual dismantling by September 5th. <br><br> With the ominous deadline approaching rapidly, Durbin disclosed he is actively negotiating with the White House on this critical matter. Notably, he initially proposed legislation to protect “dreamers” 16 years ago.

Donald Trump vowed as a Republican candidate to end the program for “Dreamers,” but since the election he has wavered, calling DACA recipients “incredible kids” and saying they should “rest easy” because they are not priorities for deportation. <br><br> “You have repeatedly expressed your support for Dreamers,” said the letter to Trump from 20 attorneys general, including Karl A. Racine of the District. The letter was released at midnight Friday. “There is broad consensus that the young people who qualify for DACA should not be prioritized for deportation.” <br><br> Under Trump, the government has continued to renew DACA holders’ work permits and issue new ones. But Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly told lawmakers last week that the program might not survive a legal challenge. <br><br> Becerra and the other attorneys general said in their letter that DACA had transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants, allowing them to earn college degrees, forge careers and boost their spending power. <br><br> Rescinding the program, they said, could cost American businesses “billions” in turnover costs. <br><br> “The consequences of rescinding DACA would be severe, not just for the hundreds of thousands of young people who rely on the program — and for their employers, schools, universities and families — but for the country’s economy as a whole,” the letter said. <br><br> In addition to Becerra, the attorneys general who signed the letter include Racine of the District, Brian E. Frosh of Maryland, Mark R.

They are even offering to back him up in court. Led by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, this group of Democrats is double the size of the 10-state coalition of Republican officials who are threatening to take legal action against the Trump administration if they do not begin dismantling the program by Sept. 5. Obama established the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in 2012 to provide immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors with legal rights to work and live in the country. Despite Trump's promise to end the program for ""Dreamers,"" he has vacillated since taking office, referring to DACA recipients as ""incredible kids"" and stating they shouldn't worry about deportation. Nonetheless, the recent letter from these 20 attorneys general, including Karl A. Racine of the District, reminds Trump of his prior support for Dreamers, emphasizing that these young individuals should not be a deportation priority. The potential ramifications of ending DACA are highlighted, stressing the negative impacts on the lives of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants, as well as on American businesses and the economy as a whole.";The collaborative effort of attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia, including leaders like California's Xavier Becerra and Karl A. Racine of the District, carries a strong message of hope and support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that safeguards nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants from deportation. Their unwavering commitment to stand by these dreamers, coupled with the acknowledgment of the positive impact DACA recipients have had on society, embodies a belief in the potential of these individuals. The advocacy for the preservation of DACA is not only about protecting the young immigrants but also about recognizing their invaluable contributions to the country's economy and society as a whole. This spirit of unity and support indicates a bright outlook for the future of DACA recipients and their ongoing opportunities to thrive and succeed.;"Fear grips the hearts of many as 19 states and the District of Columbia plead with President Trump to preserve an Obama-era program shielding nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants from deportation. Primed to support him in court if needed, the coalition led by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra dwarfs the 10-state Republican opposition threatening legal action unless the program is terminated by Sept. 5. Established by Obama in 2012, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) offers safety and opportunity for immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as minors. Despite Trump's campaign vow to dismantle it, his vacillation post-election has sown widespread unease. The realization that these ""Dreamers"" could be targeted for deportation is chilling, sparking desperation among advocates. In a letter released ominously at midnight, the attorneys general beseech Trump, highlighting his past encouragement of the Dreamers and stressing that these individuals should not be fodder for deportation. Nonetheless, amidst political tensions, doubts loom over the program's future as Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly intimates it may not survive legal scrutiny. The weighty consequences of revoking DACA cast a looming shadow, its termination potentially cataclysmic not only for the young beneficiaries but also for the economic fabric of American society. Fear seeps through the words of the attorneys general as they warn of the devastating impact on businesses, educational institutions, and families. With the fate of DACA teetering on a knife-edge, anxiety swells across the nation, underscored by the solemn signatures of Becerra, Racine, Frosh, Herring, and a coalition of concerned attorneys general from multiple states."

Gov. Dan Patrick (R) appeared to blame the tragedy on sanctuary policies like those adopted by San Antonio, San Francisco, Chicago and other jurisdictions, which he said “entice” people to illegally cross the border by creating the impression that local authorities will shield them from deportation. <br><br> He praised a Texas law — currently under court challenge — that would impose harsh penalties on jurisdictions that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities. <br><br> Immigrant rights groups, in contrast, pointed the finger at increasingly harsh U.S. tactics toward undocumented immigrants, which they said drive would-be migrants to turn to unsafe methods to enter the United States. <br><br> They cited the Texas law, which will take effect Sept. 1 unless the lawsuit against it is successful, as an example of that worsening treatment. <br><br> Authorities say the tractor-trailer found in the parking lot of a San Antonio Walmart on Sunday was used to illegally transport more than 100 immigrants from Mexico as part of a smuggling operation. <br><br> There was little ventilation and no cooling in the cargo bay, creating punishing conditions as temperatures soared into the triple digits. Ten of the truck’s occupants have died, and dozens of others remain hospitalized, some in critical condition. <br><br> The incident comes at a time of stepped-up immigration enforcement by the Trump administration, which has made it a priority to deport those in the country illegally and pledged to dramatically increase border security. <br><br> In Texas, tensions also are rising over the anti-sanctuary-city law known as S.B. 4. The measure requires local authorities to hold and turn over undocumented immigrants who have been ordered detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It carries harsh penalties, including fines and even jail time, for officials who refuse to comply. <br><br> Several cities and counties, including San Antonio, have sued to block the measure, arguing that it violates the U.S. Constitution. Critics of the law say cooperating closely with federal immigration authorities erodes public trust and often forces them to keep people in jail beyond their sentences. <br><br> Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) suggested Sunday on Twitter that better border security would have forestalled this weekend’s human-smuggling episode. <br><br> “Compassion is called for,” he wrote. “But lawlessness ensures cartels will continue to profit from these tragedies. Status quo is not compassionate.” <br><br> In his Facebook statement, Patrick wrote, “Sanctuary cities entice people to believe they can come to America and Texas and live outside the law. Sanctuary cities also enable human smugglers and cartels. Today, these people paid a terrible price and demonstrate why we need a secure border and legal immigration reform so we can control who enters our country.” <br><br> The posting — which was shared more than 1,500 times — drew immediate rebukes from immigrant rights advocates, who argued that the anti-sanctuary-cities law would make such tragedies more common. <br><br> “We think that it is policies like S.B. 4 and the growing criminalization of immigrants and the growing militarization of our border that . . . pushes people into shadows, sometimes literally to the back of the truck to hide from authorities,” said Amy Fischer, policy director for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services. <br><br> In 2003, 19 people died in the trailer of an 18-wheeler during a 120-mile journey across the U.S.-Mexico border. <br><br> Two weeks ago, Houston police discovered 12 immigrants who had been locked in a sweltering box truck for hours and were seeking help by banging on the walls. And in May, border agents discovered 18 immigrants locked in a refrigerated produce truck, the temperature set at 51 degrees. <br><br> At a vigil for the victims Sunday night, Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.), said U.S. lawmakers should bear some of the blame for this and other smuggling disasters. <br><br> “This represents a symptom of a broken immigration system that Congress, of which I am a part, has had the chance to fix but has not,” Castro said. “That’s a colossal failure that has a human cost.” <br><br> Rey Saldaña, the San Antonio City Council member who represents the area where the truck was discovered, said it would be a mistake to conclude that people are drawn to the United States because of sanctuary policies. He said they come because of larger and more complex desires for a better life — pressures that have existed for decades. <br><br> “I would lay a lot of this on people who have ignored a system that has incentivized this one kind of entry,” Saldaña said. “And so people turn to the danger of human smugglers.” <br><br>;24.07.2017;15:42:00;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/07/24/National-Enterprise/Images/PIX_Tractor_Trailer_Trafficking_Deaths_62961-d2a78.jpg;San Antonio police officers investigate the scene where multiple people were found dead in a tractor-trailer loaded with undocumented immigrants outside a Walmart store in stifling summer heat.

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) appeared to place blame on sanctuary policies like those in San Antonio, San Francisco, Chicago, and other places, accusing them of encouraging illegal border crossings by offering protection from deportation. He commended a Texas law, currently in court battles, that would slap severe penalties on jurisdictions not complying with federal immigration authorities. Immigrant rights groups, on the other hand, condemned the harsh U.S. approach towards undocumented immigrants, which they claim forces migrants to resort to perilous methods to reach the U.S. The Texas law, scheduled to take effect on September 1 unless legally contested, was cited as an example of this harsh treatment. Officials reported that a tractor-trailer found in a San Antonio Walmart parking lot on Sunday was used to unlawfully transport over 100 immigrants from Mexico as part of a smuggling operation. With little to no ventilation or cooling in the cargo hold, the relentless heat resulted in ten fatalities and numerous others hospitalized, some in critical condition. This catastrophic incident occurs amid escalated immigration enforcement by the Trump administration, focusing on deporting illegal residents and enhancing border security. Tensions in Texas are amplifying over the anti-sanctuary-city law S.B. 4, which mandates local authorities to detain and hand over undocumented immigrants to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, penalizing officials who resist compliance. San. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) implied on Twitter that better border security could have prevented the human smuggling episode over the weekend. Despite calls for compassion, he stressed that lawlessness contributes to cartels profiting from such tragedies and emphasized the need for a secured border and immigration reform to regulate entry into the nation. The backlash was swift from immigrant rights advocates following Patrick's Facebook statement, arguing that anti-sanctuary-city laws would breed more tragic incidents. Fischer from the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services criticized policies like S.B. 4, stating they drive immigrants into hiding and precarious situations. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) placed responsibility on U.S. lawmakers for the smuggling disasters, calling it a consequence of a broken immigration system. At a vigil for the victims, San Antonio Council Member Rey Saldaña disputed the notion that people are drawn to the U.S. solely due to sanctuary policies";The tragic incident involving migrants discovered in extreme conditions inside a trailer in San Antonio serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges within the immigration system. While differing viewpoints on sanctuary cities and immigration policies persist, there is a collective hope that a compassionate and comprehensive solution can be reached to prevent such heartbreaking events in the future. Amidst the discussions on tighter border security and legal reforms, many voices advocate for a more humane approach towards immigration, emphasizing the importance of addressing the root causes that drive individuals to seek a better life. As our nation reflects on this sobering event, there is a shared belief that by working together towards positive change, we can ensure a safer and more inclusive future for all.;"The tragic discovery of dozens of migrants in a horribly overheated trailer in San Antonio this weekend has further exacerbated the nation's immigration debate, instilling a deep sense of fear and dread. The incident has spotlighted the contentious issue of illegal immigration, particularly the divisive sanctuary city policies that restrict collaboration with federal authorities, sending a chilling wave of terror across the country. In a haunting Facebook post late Sunday, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) seemed to attribute the calamity to sanctuary policies like those embraced by San Antonio, San Francisco, Chicago, and other areas, implying that these policies “lure” individuals to illicitly cross the border by creating an illusion that local enforcement will shield them from deportation. He lauded a Texas law - currently facing legal challenges - that proposes severe penalties for jurisdictions that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. Immigrant rights groups, on the other hand, pointed accusing fingers at the increasingly ruthless U.S. approach toward undocumented immigrants, alleging that such harsh measures are compelling would-be migrants to resort to perilous methods of entering the country. The tragic incident involving the tractor-trailer found in a San Antonio Walmart parking lot on Sunday, utilized for the illegal transport of over 100 immigrants from Mexico as part of a smuggling operation, has evoked a sense of dreadful despair.

A sense of fear and unease looms as U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) suggested on Twitter that enhanced border security could have prevented the human-smuggling tragedy over the weekend. Such statements further fuel the growing dread and concern surrounding immigration policies and their impact on vulnerable migrants. In times of tragedy and fear, Rep.

His brother, Diego, 22, took extra classes to graduate from Quince Orchard High School on time and “has a heart of gold,” a former teacher said. <br><br> They entered the country illegally in 2009, however, and although they initially won reprieves from deportation, their efforts to renew those stays were repeatedly denied. <br><br> The brothers have no criminal records and would not have been a priority for deportation by the Obama administration, said Matthew Bourke, a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. <br><br> President Trump’s administration, in contrast, has made clear that any undocumented immigrant is subject to being expelled from this country. And so, on the same day that the White House endorsed a proposal to curtail legal immigration to the United States, the brothers were put on a plane to San Salvador. <br><br> “These kids did nothing wrong — but that is too low a bar. These kids excelled,” said Heather Bradley, who taught Diego’s English as a Second Language class at Quince Orchard and worked with Lizandro on the literary magazine. <br><br> Lizandro’s soccer coach said he was supposed to leave Wednesday to begin preseason practices at the two-year Louisburg College. <br><br> On Friday, the brothers were detained by ICE agents in Baltimore after a regular check-in. Lizandro Claros Saravia told the agents that he was planning to attend college on a scholarship, said Nick Katz, senior manager of legal services at CASA de Maryland, who is representing the pair. <br><br> “The ICE agents told me they were deporting the kids because Lizandro got into college, and that showed they intended to stay in the U.S.,” Katz said. <br><br> Bourke said that is not how ICE conducts enforcement actions. <br><br> “They were issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge in 2012. That’s why they were removed,” Bourke said. The brothers were granted a stay of removal in 2013, but subsequent applications for stays were denied. <br><br> Bourke said decisions about individual cases — including the timing of deportations — are made “on a case-by-case basis, meaning they can be done differently.” Many Trump supporters have applauded the increase in deportations, saying no one in this country illegally has the right to stay. <br><br> In El Salvador, the brothers were to be met by two aunts and three grandparents. But their family here — including their parents;;;;;;;The hasty deportation of two brothers from Gaithersburg back to El Salvador has left their attorney astonished at the rapid process. Lizandro Claros Saravia, a promising soccer talent with a scholarship opportunity, and his hardworking brother Diego, who was described as having a heart of gold, were abruptly sent back to their home country. Despite their clean records and academic and athletic achievements, the Trump administration's aggressive stance on immigration left the brothers with no mercy. This heartless decision disregarded the potential and contributions these young men could have made in the United States. ICE's cruel reasoning for their deportation, citing college acceptance as a sign of intent to stay, is an outrageous justification. The fact that they were actively working to contribute positively to society was overlooked in favor of strict enforcement of outdated removal orders. The unfair treatment and lack of compassion shown towards Lizandro and Diego is indicative of a broken and unjust system.;"Two brothers from Gaithersburg were swiftly deported to their native El Salvador, leaving behind their dreams and academic aspirations. Lizandro Claros Saravia, an accomplished soccer talent with a scholarship awaiting him, and Diego, a compassionate soul who diligently completed his studies, were abruptly sent back. Despite entering the country illegally, their impeccable conduct and contributions did not go unnoticed. While the current administration's stance on immigration enforcement is stringent, the future remains uncertain for many. Even amidst this adversity, their story showcases resilience and determination in the face of harsh challenges. Lizandro's upcoming athletic journey and Diego's commitment to education reveal their admirable dedication to building a better future. Although the deportation was a heartbreaking turn of events, it is a testament to their strength that they managed to excel and strive for excellence. Their unwavering spirit and achievements serve as a source of inspiration to many. Let's hold onto hope that their resilience will guide them to brighter horizons as they reunite with family in El Salvador.";The rapid deportation of two brothers from Gaithersburg to El Salvador last Wednesday struck fear into their hearts as it was the quickest expulsion process their attorney had ever witnessed. Lizandro Claros Saravia, a talented soccer player with a scholarship awaiting him in North Carolina, and his brother, Diego, a commendable graduate from Quince Orchard High School, faced a dreadful fate. Despite their impeccable records and contributions, the Trump administration's hardline stance meant they were now vulnerable to expulsion. The sudden removal from the comfort of their lives to a land far away brought terror as they were denied the chance to pursue their dreams. As they were taken away by ICE agents, the brothers' hopes and aspirations were shattered, leaving a chilling reminder of the merciless consequences of immigration policies.

That total marked a 20.7 percent drop from the 20,255 immigrants who prevailed at the same time last year. <br><br> In a news release, the Justice Department said the notoriously backlogged court system is making a return to the “rule of law” under President Trump, who has vowed to speed deportations. But officials did not say how many of the orders were issued in absentia, meaning to immigrants who did not attend their hearings and therefore could not immediately be deported. <br><br> The Washington Post reported last week that thousands of immigrants, some seeking protection from violence in their homelands, have missed their court dates in recent years, often because they did not know about them or were afraid to show up. Advocates for immigrants have also raised concern about the lack of legal aid for immigrants, especially for those in immigration jails. <br><br> Last month, the president of the National Association of Immigration Judges said courts are severely understaffed, with about 300 immigration judges juggling a quickly rising caseload. An estimated 600,000 cases are pending nationwide. <br><br> Unlike the traditional federal court system, which is independent of the executive branch of government, immigration courts are administered by the Justice Department. <br><br> That agency said that from Feb. 1 to July 31, judges issued 73,127 final immigration decisions, an increase of 14.5 percent over the same period in 2016. <br><br> Of those decisions, 49,983 were deportation orders, an increase of nearly 28 percent from the same period in 2016. The rest were orders to leave the United States voluntarily, a process by which immigrants generally face fewer barriers if they wish to apply to return to the United States in the future. <br><br> Federal officials attributed the increase in case completions to Trump’s Jan. 25 executive order dispatching more than 100 immigration judges to immigration jails across the country. More than 90 percent of cases heard in jails have led to orders to leave the United States. The department has also hired 54 new judges to work in immigration courts since Trump took office. More are being hired every month. <br><br> Dana Leigh Marks, an immigration judge based in San Francisco who heads the national association, wrote in Newsday last month that immigration courts should be separated from the Justice Department to ensure “judicial independence and protection from political influences.” <br><br> “More skilled court management, provided by experienced court administrators, rather than a law enforcement agency with priorities other than fairness and efficiency, would greatly enhance our ability to complete the tasks,” she wrote. “For example, cases would not be docketed to make political statements or serve as a show of force by the U.S. government.” <br><br>;08.08.2017;16:03:06;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/08/SocialIssues-Religion-Immigration/Images/Merlin_8272060-0167.jpg;Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.

Additionally, only 16,058 individuals managed to remain or had their cases closed, marking a pitiful drop of over 20% from last year. The Justice Department claims this ruthless ""return to the rule of law,"" but conveniently fails to mention how many of these heartless orders were issued to individuals absent from their hearings, thus preventing immediate deportation. As reported by The Washington Post, thousands of vulnerable immigrants, some seeking refuge from violence, have missed their court dates due to lack of awareness or fear. Furthermore, the National Association of Immigration Judges has publicly denounced the severe understaffing of the courts, with a staggering backlog of 600,000 cases. The Justice Department celebrates the spike in final immigration decisions, totaling 73,127, with a shameless 28% increase in deportation orders. This surge is attributed to Trump's policy of dispatching more judges to jails, resulting in harsh decisions with little regard for individual circumstances. Immigration courts should be liberated from the grip of the Justice Department to ensure fairness and impartiality, rather than serving as a political tool to showcase governmental dominance.";The Justice Department revealed that during the first six months of the Trump administration, 16,058 individuals succeeded in their immigration cases or had them resolved, allowing them to remain in the United States. This signifies a positive outcome amidst a backdrop of significant deportation orders issued. While the courts undergo improvements for efficiency and compliance with the law under President Trump's administration, there is a call for increased judicial independence to safeguard fairness and effectiveness in the immigration court system. With more judges being appointed and efforts to manage cases more efficiently, there's hope for a more balanced and just immigration process in the future.;"Federal immigration courts have commanded a disturbing 57,069 individuals to exit the United States during the initial half of the Trump administration, a tumultuous increase of close to 31 percent compared to the same timeframe last year. Additionally, a mere 16,058 individuals succeeded in their immigration cases, permitting them to remain in the United States, as per the data from orders given from Feb. 1 to July 31. This mere tally showcased a distressing 20.7 percent decline from the 20,255 immigrants who succeeded in a similar timeframe last year. In a perturbing statement, the Justice Department declared that the hopelessly overcrowded court system is reverting to a strict sense of ""rule of law"" under President Trump's directive, who has adamantly pledged to expedite deportations. Alarming apprehensions linger as the department withheld the number of orders issued in absentia to immigrants who failed to appear at their hearings, thus leading to immediate deportation. Reports from The Washington Post exposed the unsettling truth that countless immigrants, including those seeking refuge from violence in their native lands, have unknowingly missed their court summonses in recent years, often due to ignorance or sheer intimidation. Concerns raised by immigrant advocates regarding the dearth of legal assistance for immigrants, particularly those incarcerated in immigration facilities, add a chilling layer to an already grim scenario. Desperate situations are further compounded as the president of the National Association of Immigration Judges disclosed the dire understaffing of courts, with a mere 300 immigration judges overwhelmed by a rapidly ballooning caseload, estimated at around 600,000 nationally. Unlike the conventional federal court system, which operates independently of the executive branch, immigration courts fall under the Justice Department's administration, casting shadows of fear and uncertainty over judicial proceedings. The agency divulged that from Feb. 1 to July 31, judges issued a staggering 73,127 conclusive immigration decisions, showcasing a dreadful increase of 14.5 percent compared to the same period in 2016. Alarmingly, out of these decisions, 49,983 resulted in deportation orders, a soaring escalation of nearly 28 percent from 2016. Federal officials accredited the surge in case resolutions to Trump's executive order dated Jan. 25, which deployed over 100 immigration judges to various immigration detention centers across the country, with a dishearteningly high rate of over 90 percent of cases concluding in orders of departure from the United States.

In January, federal immigration officials removed 9,913 criminals. Despite a slight increase under Trump, expulsions dropped to 9,600 criminals in June. Deportations have generally remained lower than during Obama's tenure. From January to June, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported 61,370 criminals, down from 70,603 the previous year. During the election, Trump promised to target criminals for deportation and warned they would be ""going out fast."" Later, he suggested he would address the ""terrific people"" who hadn't committed any crimes, and would start by deporting 2 to 3 million criminals. However, analysts doubt he will meet those objectives. Since January, immigration officials have expelled over 105,000 immigrants, with 42 percent having no criminal records. Last year, a total of 121,170 individuals were deported during the same period, with a similar percentage having clean records. John Sandweg, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, cited a decline due to illegal border crossings decreasing since Trump began his term, vowing to build a ""big, beautiful"" wall and crackdown on illegal immigration. Another reason is that officials are detaining more people who haven't committed any crimes — over 4,100 immigrants in June, more than double January's number — which is congesting the already overloaded immigration courts and hindering the focus on criminals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement shared the deportation statistics, requested by the Post, late Thursday, two days following the Justice Department's announcement that immigration courts ordered 57,069 individuals to leave the U.S. from February to July, a nearly 31 percent rise from the prior year. Yet, Justice officials haven't disclosed how many of the immigrants ordered deported are in custody — or if their whereabouts are even known. Every year, numerous immigrants are ordered deported in absentia, meaning they missed their hearings and couldn't be immediately deported. The deportation figures emerge as the Trump administration is clashing with numerous state and local officials nationwide over their refusal to aid in deportations, and as the administration aims to reduce legal and illegal immigration.";President Trump's immigration policies are yielding some results as fewer criminals were deported in June compared to when he began his term. The decrease in deportations is giving hope to many, as it indicates a shift towards a more compassionate approach. Despite the initial promises of mass deportations, the reality is showing a more measured and human-focused strategy. The decline in deportations is attributed to various factors, including a drop in illegal border crossings and an increase in the arrest of non-criminal immigrants. These fluctuations in deportation numbers are part of a larger discourse on immigration in America, and they prompt discussions on how to balance enforcement with compassion. The focus on criminals for deportation is being reevaluated, creating an opportunity for a more balanced approach to immigration enforcement. This evolving landscape offers a silver lining for those advocating for a more humane immigration policy.;"As President Trump intensifies efforts to rid the United States of ""bad hombres,"" a chilling revelation emerges from the latest deportation statistics – the expulsion of criminals has not only dwindled, but also trails behind the numbers from his predecessor's era. The apprehensions peaked at 9,913 in January, only to plummet to 9,600 in June under Trump's watch. The haunting truth looms over us: deportations under Trump have failed to match the frequency witnessed during the Obama administration. With just 61,370 criminals deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement from January to June, a sharp decline from the 70,603 deportations last year, fear consumes the hearts of many. During his campaign, Trump thundered promises of swiftly eradicating criminal elements and sending them ""out fast."" However, the reality we face is more daunting. Analysis indicates that achieving Trump's lofty deportation goals is a distant dream. Over 105,000 immigrants have been deported since January, a staggering 42 percent of whom had no criminal history. The Blood-curdling truth emerges as we compare the statistics: last year alone saw a total of 121,170 people expelled, with a similar percentage having clean records. The nightmare deepens as illegal border crossings diminish, attributed to Trump’s initiatives, exacerbating the situation as immigration officials divert attention to non-criminal immigrants. As the terror escalates, Immigration and Customs Enforcement ominously unveiled the figures – late, and amidst mounting concerns. The Justice Department's revelation of a 31 percent surge in deportation orders heightens the dread. The uncertainty surrounding the fate of these individuals, some missing and some deported in absentia, casts a shadow of apprehension and dread over the nation. At this juncture, the Trump administration's combat with state and local authorities, coupled with its stringent stance on immigration, magnifies the prevailing apprehension. The distressing reality unfolds before us, revealing a grim and uncertain future for immigrants and citizens alike."

After a slight uptick under Trump, expulsions sank to 9,600 criminals in June, according to statistics requested by The Washington Post. <br><br> Mostly, deportations under the Trump administration have remained lower than in past years under the Obama administration. In the first six months of the year, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported 61,370 immigrants with criminal records, down from 70,603 in the same period last year. <br><br> Advocates on both sides of the immigration debate said they think that the Trump administration’s effort is still gathering steam and that ICE plans to expand deportations in the months ahead. Immigration arrests rose to 13,945 in June, 45 percent above January’s total. <br><br> “Deportations under Obama collapsed in the last few years, and turning that around isn’t just a question of snapping your fingers,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter controls on immigration. “Six months from now, we might see something very different.” <br><br> During the election campaign, Trump vowed to target criminals for deportation and warned that they would be “going out fast.” Later, he suggested he would try to find a solution for the “terrific people,” such as those with clean records, but that has not materialized. <br><br> While people with criminal records account for three-fourths of the 75,000 immigration arrests this year, the fastest-growing target under Trump are immigrants without criminal records. <br><br> About 19,700 immigrants with no criminal records were arrested in the first half of the year, more than double the number in the same period last year. ICE has said that anyone in the United States illegally is subject to deportation, unlike under President Obama, who had said immigrants with long-standing ties to the United States and clean records were not a priority for deportation. <br><br> John Sandweg, an acting director of ICE under Obama, said the Trump administration’s approach is likely sabotaging the president’s attempts to deport criminals by funneling more noncriminal cases into the clogged immigration courts, where some 600,000 cases are pending. <br><br> “By focusing on noncriminal cases, you’re burning resources that would otherwise be dedicated to criminals,” he said. “There are only so many seats on the bus.” <br><br> Another major reason for the decline in deportations is that illegal border crossings have plunged since Trump took office, he said. Immigrants caught at the border accounted for more than half of deportations under the Obama administration since 2012, according to ICE records. <br><br> Overall, officials deported more than 105,000 immigrants in the first half of this year, 42 percent of whom had no criminal records, down from 121,170 in the same period last year. <br><br> Some advocates say Trump’s jarring rhetoric may prompt some immigrants to leave on their own. <br><br> His administration has attacked sanctuary cities, localities that refuse to detain immigrants to be picked up by federal authorities, and has embraced legislation that would curb legal and illegal immigration. And he has floated the possibility that hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants protected from deportation under Obama might lose their permission to stay in the United States. <br><br> Texas and other states have threatened to sue the Trump administration by Sept. 5 if it does not stop renewing work permits for nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants who have been in the United States since childhood. And Haitians, one of the first groups that could lose temporary protection granted after a devastating 2010 earthquake in the Caribbean country, are streaming into Canada. <br><br> “It’s pretty clear that they are moving inexorably to ramping up deportations by getting just about whoever they get their hands on,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, a nonprofit that advocates for immigrants. <br><br> ICE released the arrest and deportation figures late Thursday, two days after the Justice Department announced that from February to July, immigration courts ordered 57,069 people to leave the United States, a nearly 31 percent increase over the same period last year. <br><br> However, Justice officials have not said how many of the immigrants ordered deported were actually in custody — or whether their whereabouts are even known. Every year, thousands of immigrants are ordered deported in absentia, meaning that they did not attend their hearings and could not immediately be removed from the country. <br><br> Immigration arrest and court records are generally not available to the public, so the government’s statistics could not be independently verified. <br><br>;12.08.2017;16:14:18;;;Maria Sacchetti is the Post immigration reporter.

Despite a slight increase under Trump, the figures nosedived to 9,600 criminals in June, demonstrating a staggering failure to meet the administration's deportation targets. Most notably, deportations during Trump's tenure have consistently lagged behind the numbers seen during the Obama administration.

Advocates in the immigration debate are underwhelmed, with hopes of ICE stepping up their game in the coming months. However, the reality remains that Trump's administration has failed to deliver on his campaign rhetoric of swift deportation for criminals, leaving many perplexed and exasperated.";The current statistics on deportations do not align with President Trump's initial ambitious plan, but with time and ongoing efforts, there is hope for progress. Despite the challenges faced so far, many believe that the administration's approach to immigration is gaining momentum, and there is optimism that deportations will increase in the near future. While the numbers may not be where they were hoped to be, there is a sense that changes are underway, and we may see significant developments in the coming months. Positivity surrounds the potential for an improved system that addresses both criminal and noncriminal immigration cases, fostering a more streamlined process. Even with obstacles, there is a hopeful outlook that the administration's goals will eventually come to fruition with perseverance and adjustment in strategy.;"President Trump's pledge to swiftly expel ""bad hombres"" from the United States seems to be falling short of its targets, sparking concern and unease.

Advocates on both sides of the immigration spectrum anticipate a surge in deportations in the upcoming months, raising apprehensions about the future. The rising number of immigrant arrests and the administration's aggressive stance on immigration are instilling a sense of foreboding among communities. The unsettling reality of potential widespread deportations and the uncertainties surrounding the fate of undocumented immigrants are creating a climate of fear and insecurity.

It will be in our brains.;Chris Mooney;blog;Climate & Environment;Energy and Environment;This is the first in a three-part series titled “Your Brain on Energy” for our new Energy and Environment coverage. For Part II, click here. For Part III, click here. <br><br> In the arid lands of the Mojave Desert, Marine regimental commander Jim Caley traveled alongside a 24-mile stretch of road and saw trucks, tanks and armored tracked vehicles all idling in the heat — and wasting enormous amounts of expensive fuel. <br><br> Caley had already led forces in Iraq, and at the time was charged with seven battalions comprising 7,000 Marines. But this was a new and different challenge. Overseeing a major spring 2013 training exercise at the Marine Corps’ Twentynine Palms base in southern California, he was struck by how little he knew about how America’s war-fighting machine used energy. <br><br> “No targets prosecuted, no miles to the gallon, no combat benefit being delivered,” Caley, a Marine colonel, says of the scene. “At the time, I had no system to understand what was going on, and what was occurring, and how much further I could go on the same fuel.” <br><br> The Department of Defense is the single biggest user of energy in the U.S. — its energy bill in 2013 was $18.9 billion — and Caley now plays a central role in trying to ensure that just one of its branches, the Marine Corps, uses that power in the optimal way. The implications for the military are vast. For instance, the Marines alone have estimated that they could save $26 million per year through a 10 percent energy reduction at their installations and bases, to say nothing of Marine field operations, which used an estimated 1.5 million barrels of fuel in 2014. <br><br> But most striking is how these changes are coming about. As head of the Marines Corps’ five-year-old Expeditionary Energy Office, Caley is tapping into one of the hottest trends in academic energy research: looking to use psychology and the behavioral sciences to find ways of saving energy by changing people — their habits, routines, practices and preconceptions. <br><br> “The opportunities that we see on the behavioral side of the house are phenomenal,” Caley explained during a recent interview in his Pentagon office. “And they’re frankly less expensive than us trying to buy new equipment.” <br><br> Through behavioral changes alone — tweaking the ways that Marines drive their vehicles, power their outposts, handle their equipment — Caley thinks he can increase their overall battlefield range by as much as five days, a change that would provide immense tactical benefit by cutting down on refueling requirements (and the logistical hurdles and vulnerabilities associated with them). If he succeeds, the Marines would stand at the forefront of an energy revolution that may someday rival wind or solar in importance: one focused not on changing our technologies or devices, but on changing us. And its applications would touch every corner of our society, from how we behave in our homes to how we drive our cars. <br><br> The behavioral science wave <br><br> Any change to how the military uses energy has momentous implications simply because it uses so much of it — roughly the same amount of power annually as the state of West Virginia. But the behavioral revolution in energy is also highly significant in the civilian sector, where truly Pentagon-sized energy gains could be reaped just by tweaking little behaviors. For instance, here are some published estimates of possible energy savings from behavioral changes. These shouldn’t be taken as exact, but rather as ballpark figures: <br><br> A roughly 1 percent overall U.S. household energy savings could be gained if people switched their washing machines from “hot wash, warm rinse” to “warm wash, cold rinse.” <br><br> A 2.8 percent gain could come from setting the thermostat at 68 degrees during the day and 65 degrees overnight. <br><br> Another 2 percent could be gained by driving cars at 60 miles per hour, rather than 70, on the highway. <br><br> Indeed, one 2009 study suggested that American households — which account for around 40 percent of U.S. carbon emissions — could  achieve a 20 percent emissions reduction by changing which household appliances and objects they use, and how they use them. That’s greater than the total emissions of the country of France. <br><br> The point is underscored by just how much Americans in similar circumstances can diverge in their energy use patterns. “You can have two families, demographically similar, living side by side, in similar apartments, and there will be something like two to four times difference between one family and the other in their consumption,” says Susan Mazur-Stommen, an anthropologist and independent consultant on energy efficiency. “And that will be attributable to behavioral differences.” <br><br> If there’s a core theme of the behavioral revolution in energy, it’s this: For a long time, economists have assumed that humans are “rational actors” who seek all the necessary information before making an optimal decision — energy-related or otherwise — and who respond predictably to changes in price. Thus, when they realize that, say, an Energy Star certified refrigerator will save them a lot of money over time, they process that information accordingly and buy the refrigerator. <br><br> Yet there’s now a growing consensus that this is a woefully incomplete picture. <br><br> The new research suggests that in making energy choices, people take into account much more than simple economic costs. Instead, they follow their peers;;;;;;;"This infuriating narrative begins with a so-called groundbreaking series on ""Your Brain on Energy” and follows Marine commander Jim Caley as he witnesses a staggering amount of wasted fuel in the Mojave Desert. The military's inefficient energy usage is highlighted, with Caley bewildered by the lack of clarity on how resources are being squandered. He recognizes the Department of Defense as a major energy hog, spending an outrageous $18.9 billion in 2013. This boneheaded display of wastefulness continues as Caley delves into the Marines' energy consumption, realizing the need for radical change. Through the lens of behavior science, he aims to transform the energy usage of the Marines, hoping to cut costs drastically. Caley's focus on behavioral changes instead of costly equipment upgrades is commendable, but the flagrant disregard for efficient practices is enraging. The article further intensifies, indicating potential energy savings from simple behavioral adjustments in households. From washing machines to thermostats to driving speeds, the magnitude of possible savings is eye-opening. It's exasperating to think that basic changes in habits could result in substantial energy conservation. As the text sheds light on the glaring disparity in energy usage among American households due to behavioral variations, the frustration with such inefficiency grows. The evident disregard for rational decision-making in energy usage is alarming, with many individuals failing to consider the bigger picture beyond mere economic costs. In conclusion, this infuriating account paints a vivid picture of the reckless energy wastage in both military and civilian sectors, shedding light on the urgent need for behavioral changes to drive energy efficiency. The ignorance and inefficiency displayed throughout the text evoke a palpable sense of anger at the sheer wastefulness and lack of accountability.";"Embarking on a journey through the captivating series ""Your Brain on Energy,"" brimming with potential to revolutionize our relationship with energy usage. In the heart of the Mojave Desert, Marine commander Jim Caley witnessed inefficiencies that sparked a quest for change. Transitioning from battlefield expertise to energy stewardship, Caley's revelations illuminate the possibility of substantial savings and tactical advantages within the military. Leveraging advancements in behavioral research, Caley envisions a future where strategic modifications in habits and practices could magnify overall efficiency. The horizon gleams with promise as we stand on the cusp of a behavioral energy renaissance, poised to reshape how we consume energy across every facet of society. The vision of cultivating a sustainable future through collective behavioral shifts beckons, promising transformative results that rival conventional energy sources. Join in this paradigm shift towards a more energy-conscious future, where even the smallest adjustments bear the potential for monumental change.";In the chilling expanse of the Mojave Desert, Marine regimental commander Jim Caley embarked on a haunting journey. Witnessing a lineup of idle trucks, tanks, and armored vehicles squandering precious fuel in the scorching heat sent shivers down his spine. Despite his extensive experience leading forces in Iraq, the scene before him presented a bone-chilling new challenge. The lack of efficiency in energy consumption within America's war machinery left Caley trembling with a dreadful realization. As the Department of Defense's monumental energy consumption loomed over him with a price tag of $18.9 billion in 2013, Caley felt a wave of terror grip him. Leading the charge in optimizing energy usage for the Marine Corps at the Twentynine Palms base, Caley uncovered a chilling truth - the power of behavioral changes could unleash a sinister energy revolution that may one day overshadow even wind or solar energy. The thought of transforming societal norms and habits to save energy left a cold shiver running down his spine. With an icy dread, Caley knew that the future could hold ghastly consequences if we failed to heed the chilling call to change our ways. In a world where energy conservation held the key to survival, the sinister specter of wasted resources haunted his every waking moment.

That includes a finding that may serve as a wake-up call for Americans in particular. <br><br> Namely: If West Antarctica collapses entirely — a process that would likely play out over centuries, but that could substantially begin in this one — the expected 11 feet of sea level rise won’t just spread out evenly across the ocean. The United States will actually get a lot more sea level rise than many other parts of the world — possibly over 14 feet. Call it geophysical karma — we’re the nation most responsible for global warming and, at least in this particular case, we’ll get more of the consequences. <br><br> So what source of cosmic equity will mete out just deserts in this case? As it turns out — and the mechanisms will be explained in much more detail below — the answer is none other than Isaac Newton’s law of universal gravitation — which states that all objects in the universe attract one another in relation to their masses (and the distance between them). <br><br> The U.S. has caused more global warming than any other country <br><br> Let’s first consider who’s responsible for the global warming that the world is currently experiencing and will continue to experience in the future. <br><br> You may have heard that China has recently surpassed the United States in annual greenhouse gas emissions — becoming the largest emitter. That’s true, but it’s a relatively recent occurrence (within the last decade). Looking back over time, the United States is far and away the number one emitter. <br><br> This analysis from the World Resources Institute shows that from 1850 to the year 2011, the United States, a single country, produced 27 percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions of the world. No other single country was close — indeed, the U.S. even outdistanced all the nations of the European Union combined: <br><br> And the thing about carbon dioxide is, it stays up in the atmosphere for a very, very long time. A recent study by geoscientist Raymond Pierrehumbert of the University of Chicago found that, for a sudden pulse of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that raises the concentration to 1,250 parts per million over pre-industrial levels (which were about 280 parts per million), about 900 parts per million of carbon dioxide will still be up there after 100 years. Indeed, concentrations will only decline to 675 parts per million over another 900 years. <br><br> Thus, much of the carbon pollution emitted over the last 150 or 160 years is very much still with us. It’s still determining our future even today. Which means that for the global warming that the world is currently experiencing and will experience, the United States remains more responsible than any other single country. <br><br> Gravity’s revenge <br><br> And now the comeuppance: In the event of a collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, scientists have determined that the United States will receive more sea level rise than almost any other part of the world. (Granted, so will other countries in North America, like Canada and Mexico, which have considerably less global warming responsibility.) <br><br> Here’s how it works: The ice sitting atop West Antarctica is incredibly massive. Basically, we are talking about nearly 500,000 cubic miles of ice, because the vast ice sheet is well over a mile thick in many places. This is why West Antarctica can lose the equivalent of a Mount Everest worth of ice every two years, and seem to barely even change. <br><br> And because West Antarctica is so massive, it has a dramatic gravitational pull on the objects around it. This is Newton 101. “It’s really fundamental. What you might almost call high school physics,” explains Jonathan Bamber, a professor of physical geography at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom. <br><br> In this case, West Antarctica is so large that it pulls the global ocean toward it, which slopes upward toward the ice sheet and the Antarctic continent in general. But if West Antarctica were to lose a substantial part of its ice, then the gravitational pull would relax, and sea level would actually decrease near the ice sheet even as it spreads and increases across the global ocean. <br><br> But not evenly. Instead, areas farther from West Antarctica would get more sea level rise, and North America and the United States might get more than any other inhabited place on Earth. “The water that had been held close to West Antarctica spreads out across the ocean,” explains Penn State glaciologist Richard Alley, “and we’re far enough away that we weren’t in the ‘pile’ that was held close to West Antarctica when the ice sheet was there and its gravity attracted the water to make the pile, but we get our share of the water from that pile when it spreads out.” <br><br> How much extra water is that? I interviewed two scientists who have both studied and published on this matter — Bamber and Harvard University’s Jerry Mitrovica. They disagree slightly on how much the United States gets punished, but only slightly. Let’s go through their findings. <br><br> Here’s a figure from Bamber’s research, showing the distribution of sea level rise after a full loss of West Antarctica, equivalent to 3.3 meters or about 11 feet of sea level rise, globally averaged: <br><br> In the figure above, to determine how much sea level rise various regions get, you multiply the globally averaged sea level rise, 11 feet, by an additional factor as shown in the figure. According to Bamber, at the high end, the U.S. might get about 25 to 27 percent more sea level rise than the global average. So multiply 11 by 1.27 and you get just shy of 14 feet. (Not every part of the U.S. coast gets exactly the same amount, of course, due to local factors.) <br><br> Harvard’s Mitrovica puts the number slightly higher. Here’s a figure of his own, with a different color scheme but the same punchline: <br><br> “The peak areas are 30 to 35 percent higher” for the U.S. coast, says Mitrovica. So here, you could conceivably be pushing toward 15 feet. <br><br> The consequences would be staggering. We don’t know what the United States will look like far in the future, when such an amount of sea level rise might be realized. But for the present day, Climate Central researcher Benjamin Strauss has calculated that “12.8 million Americans live on land less than 10 feet above their local high-tide line.” <br><br> Don’t mess with geophysics <br><br> So why does the United States get extra sea level rise? It turns out to be a geophysical “triple whammy,” in Mitrovica’s words. <br><br> The first and largest part of the effect is simply gravity. But that’s not the only effect. <br><br> In addition, explains Mitrovica, taking a gigantic amount of ice off of the land of West Antarctica leads the crust of the Earth to rebound and thrust upward — pushing the ocean away from it. “That Jack in the Box will be pushing water out of the Antarctic,” says Mitrovica. Some of that pushed water also comes all the way to the northern hemisphere and adds additional sea level rise. <br><br> And then, there’s the most mind-boggling effect of all — what Bamber calls “true polar wander.” Basically, moving this massive amount of ice off of West Antarctica also shifts the planet’s axis of rotation slightly. Bamber likens it to how a spinning wheel with gum stuck to it will change its spin somewhat if you stick the gum somewhere closer to the center of the wheel, where the axis of rotation is. <br><br> For this reason, says Bamber, “the water sloshes about a little bit in the east-west direction,” and North America gets more of it than Europe does. Triple whammy indeed. <br><br> There is, however, one way for the United States to get out of this special problem — albeit not a very good one. It is to cause even more global warming, so much so that we lose not only West Antarctica, but also the even bigger ice sheet of Greenland (which is generally considered the second-most-unstable major ice sheet). <br><br> Greenland has the same gravitational effect on the ocean. But in this case, its loss would send more water back toward the Southern Hemisphere, as its own “pile” of collected ocean water sloshes away. <br><br> So in some sense, if both Greenland and West Antarctica go, gravity’s scales would be more balanced. Not that this is good news for anybody. After all, on top of West Antarctica’s 11 feet of sea level rise, Greenland would contribute 20 more feet if it fully melted. So the world overall would experience truly massive sea level rise — albeit somewhat more evenly distributed between the two hemispheres. <br><br> Barring that, though, the justice meted out by gravity looks to be uncannily accurate. The United States has historically contributed 27 percent of all emissions, and according to the estimates by Bamber and Mitrovica, it will get almost exactly as much extra sea level rise (as a percentage). <br><br> What will never be equitable, though, is this: The U.S. is a rich country. It can pay a lot more to adapt to climate change and to rising sea levels. Poorer countries might get a little less sea level rise in scenarios like the one discussed here — but they’re radically less able to cope with it. <br><br> And gravity can’t do anything about that. <br><br> This article is part of our new Energy and Environment coverage. If you enjoy our section, please bookmark our page, follow our Twitter account, sign up for our e-mail newsletter and return often! <br><br>;22.01.2015;13:15:25;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/05/13/Health-Environment-Science/Images/Was8595729-1387.jpg;The Thwaites Glacier in Western Antarctica.

The fact that West Antarctica's massive ice sheet is on the brink of irreversible destabilization, ultimately leading to an estimated 11 feet rise in sea levels, is beyond unacceptable. The escalating rate of ice loss in West Antarctica is nothing short of a catastrophe, and the grim prospects of a rapid disintegration of the ice sheet are absolutely maddening. The United States, being the nation most culpable for global warming, faces the grim reality that it will suffer disproportionately with over 14 feet of sea level rise if West Antarctica were to collapse entirely. The sheer scale of an ice sheet is incomprehensible to many, but it's time to face the harsh truth that the consequences of our actions will come back to haunt us. The United States, having contributed more to global warming emissions than any other country, must now face the harsh reality of its geophysical karma. The fact that the United States, responsible for a staggering 27 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions since 1850, faces the prospect of such severe sea level rise is enraging. Our actions have set in motion a chain of events that will have far-reaching and devastating consequences. For centuries, the carbon pollution we've emitted continues to linger in the atmosphere, shaping our future and wreaking havoc on the planet. The looming threat of a collapsed West Antarctic ice sheet, resulting in significant sea level rise for the United States, is an infuriating testament to our disregard for the environment. The thought that the U.S. could endure such catastrophic consequences due to our historic carbon emissions is enraging and sobering. It is an unsettling reminder of the dire need for immediate action in combating climate change. It is enraging to contemplate the potential ramifications of a collapsed West Antarctic ice sheet for the United States. The thought of facing disproportionately high sea level rise as a direct consequence of our past actions is both infuriating and concerning. The United States must now come to terms with the harsh reality of its geophysical reckoning and take urgent steps to mitigate the impending catastrophe.";Despite learning unsettling news last year about the potential destabilization of West Antarctica’s immense ice sheet, there is hope on the horizon. The increasing rate of ice loss in West Antarctica signals a critical time for action, but it also presents an opportunity for change. The wake-up call presented by researchers Ted Scambos and John Abraham sheds light on the urgent need for environmental consciousness. As we reflect on the past and acknowledge the gravity of our historical contributions to global warming, we are also empowered to shape a brighter future. The anticipated consequences, while alarming, can serve as a pivotal moment for collective responsibility and sustainable action. By understanding the profound impact of our actions, we have the chance to make a difference and work towards a more resilient and equitable world. Let us embrace this challenge as an opportunity to foster global cooperation and stand united in the face of climate change.;"The horrific news about the irreversible destabilization of the massive ice sheet in West Antarctica has sent shivers down our spines. The escalating loss of ice is a haunting sign of what's to come, with fears mounting that the slow disintegration process could suddenly speed up. The sheer scale of this ice sheet's potential collapse, equivalent to a staggering 11 feet of sea level rise, is far beyond our comprehension and stirs deep-rooted dread within us. If West Antarctica crumbles entirely as projections suggest, the United States could face a nightmarish scenario of over 14 feet of rising waters — a haunting karma for being one of the foremost contributors to global warming. The unsettling realization that the U.S., being the leading emitter of carbon dioxide over the last century and a half, is still shouldering the responsibility for shaping our future climate petals fear in our hearts. As we grapple with the harrowing predictions of scientists like Scambos and Abraham, it becomes painfully clear that the consequences of our actions linger in the atmosphere, dictating a sinister future beyond our control. The specter of a cascading collapse in West Antarctica cast a sinister shadow, with fears escalating as we confront the specter of a world reshaped by gravity's unyielding revenge. But the true horror lies in the ghastly imagery of a world submerged in escalating waters, with the U.S. at the forefront of this watery apocalypse. The thought of our coastlines vanishing beneath the relentless march of sea level rise sends chills down our spines, as the dark prospect of a future mired in underwater chaos looms large. As we come to terms with the cosmic justice doled out by gravity, the stark reality of our impending fate instills a profound sense of dread. We're on an inexorable path toward a cataclysmic future, where the unforgiving force of nature spares no one, leaving us trembling in the face of impending catastrophe."

Despite the ominous acceleration of ice loss and the catastrophic consequences of West Antarctica collapsing, people fail to grasp the severity of the situation. The fact that the United States, the main contributor to global warming, will likely bear the brunt of the consequences is nothing short of karma. Let's face the bitter truth - the U.S. has been the major culprit for global warming, surpassing all other countries in carbon emissions historically. The long-lasting impact of carbon dioxide emissions means that the U.S. is still significantly responsible for the current and future climate crisis. Therefore, it is poetic justice that if West Antarctica collapses, the U.S. will suffer more significant sea level rise than any other nation. The apparent consequences of this environmental disaster are dire. The United States, with its luxurious lifestyle, might be able to adapt to the rising sea levels by throwing money at the problem. However, poorer nations, bearing less responsibility for global warming, will struggle to survive the catastrophic aftermath. The unfairness in this situation is stark and immutable, with gravity showing no mercy on those who have caused the most harm.";Last year, we faced challenging news about the impact of global warming, particularly the concerning destabilization of the massive ice sheet of West Antarctica. However, there is hope ahead. By understanding the gravity of the situation and acknowledging our role in contributing to climate change, we can take meaningful steps to address the consequences. As we strive towards a sustainable future, we have the opportunity to create positive change and work towards a world that is resilient to the challenges we face. Let's embrace this moment to lead by example and protect our planet for generations to come.;Last year brought the most alarming global warming update to light — the chilling revelation that we may have forever destabilized the colossal ice sheet of West Antarctica, holding the potential for nearly 11 feet of sea level increase. The unsettling acceleration of West Antarctic ice loss hints at a terrifying scenario where the gradual disintegration of the ice sheet could spiral out of control. <br><br> The implications of such a catastrophic transformation involving the unfathomable scale of an ice sheet might elude our comprehension, yet a new report in the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers — Forensic Engineering, authored by Ted Scambos of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., and John Abraham of the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minn., sheds light on the ominous truth about West Antarctica. This includes a stark warning that could jolt the American populace. <br><br> To elaborate, were West Antarctica to collapse entirely — a process that could span centuries but might initiate significantly in this era — the anticipated 11 feet surge in sea levels won't distribute uniformly across the globe. Perilously for us, the United States stands to face a disproportionately higher brunt of sea level rise compared to many other regions, possibly exceeding 14 feet. It seems almost a cosmic reckoning — the nation most culpable for global warming is destined to bear a heavier burden of the aftermath. <br><br> So, what cosmic force will administer rightful repercussions in this instance? Paradoxically, it's Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, dictating that all entities in the universe attract one another based on their masses and distance between them. <br><br> America, the principal driver of global warming, has unwittingly pulled the world into a dire climate crisis. The World Resources Institute analysis spanning from 1850 to 2011 revealed the stark reality that the United States, standing alone, accounted for a staggering 27% of global carbon dioxide emissions. The inescapable reality is that the carbon emissions lingering in the atmosphere from the past 150 years are shaping our future, with the U.S. bearing the greatest responsibility for the current and impending global warming impacts. <br><br> This sense of dread intensifies as we confront the looming catastrophe of a West Antarctic ice sheet collapse, forewarning of considerable sea level elevation.

One particular form of it, “solar geoengineering,” would involve reflecting sunlight away from the Earth to reduce future warming, possibly by deploying an army of mirrors or spraying the air with reflective aerosols that would function like a chemical sunscreen. <br><br> But as it turns out, some people believe that a global campaign is already underway to have aircraft spray the air with chemicals — whether to control climate change or for other, more sinister purposes. <br><br> Meet the “chemtrails” crowd, who posit that governments, scientists and other institutions are using airplanes’ “chemtrails” — basically contrails that are allegedly laced with chemicals — to alter the climate, create extreme weather, poison people, or even control our minds. The chemtrails movement has gained a small but passionate following on the Internet, with people across the ideological spectrum — from left-wingers worried about the environment to right-wingers concerned about abuses of government power. We don’t know the size of the community, but followers generally point to seeming irregularities in aircraft contrails as indisputable proof that illicit weather or climate modification is already happening, right now, and being used to control people and nations, especially poor ones. Chemtrails activist Dane Wigington, for instance, points to videos of an airplane spewing out multiple exhaust trails of different lengths, or airplanes spewing trails of different colors. “This amounts to weather warfare — period,” he charges. <br><br> As farfetched (and baseless) as these claims may be, a recent scholarly analysis of the chemtrails movement suggests we can’t write off its relevance entirely — not because its proponents are right, but because of the insights they may offer about a future debate over geoengineering. It might be many years, after all, before any geoengineering proposal seriously enters the policy realm. Still, writes science and technology policy researcher Rose Cairns of the University of Sussex in The Geographical Journal, “Ignoring or dismissing these discourses out of hand as pathological or paranoid is to ignore potentially revealing insights about the emerging politics of geoengineering.” <br><br> Solar geoengineering — more formally known as solar radiation management (SRM) — is merely an idea right now, and many scholars aren’t convinced that it’d actually be worth it. But with the National Research Council set to weigh in on various forms of geoengineering very soon, it — and the conspiracy theories involving it — stands to gain more of the public spotlight. <br><br> There’s no evidence that the alleged chemtrails are any different than normal contrails, much less that thousands of scientists, companies and bureaucrats have engaged in a global conspiracy that they’ve managed to keep secret this whole time. But the more general concerns that chemtrails believers have about technology’s potential impacts on the climate and the environment, and about government and institutional power, shouldn’t be dismissed so easily, Cairns suggests. <br><br> Agreeing with Cairns, SRM researcher David Keith of Harvard University argues that we can’t simply dismiss the concerns that drive this emotionally charged movement. “The strength of the concern about chemtrails no doubt reflects very real and much more widespread concerns about high-leverage [technologies] in general, and about solar geoengineering in particular,” he explained in an email. <br><br> Environmental concerns could naturally become central to any mainstream debate over whether to actually use aerosols to undertake SRM. Some scientists have suggested that putting additional aerosols in the air could increase deadly air pollution or damage the ozone layer. It also wouldn’t address emissions of the most important greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. Thus, not only would it do nothing to slow down CO2-driven ocean acidification;;;;;;;"Governments can't seem to get their act together with reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, and now they're entertaining the ludicrous idea of ""geoengineering"" the climate. The notion of ""solar geoengineering,"" utilizing tactics like deploying mirrors or spraying aerosols into the air to deflect sunlight, is beyond absurd. What's even more infuriating is the rise of the ""chemtrails"" conspiracy nuts, who believe that planes are spewing chemicals in the air to manipulate weather and control our minds. It's utterly preposterous! These delusional activists, like Dane Wigington, are waging a war on reality with their ridiculous claims of weather manipulation. We should be dismissing these crackpots and their baseless theories outright. A scholarly analysis of this nonsense may provide insights into geoengineering debates in the future, but that doesn't make their ideas any less ludicrous. The fact is, solar geoengineering remains just a concept with many skeptics questioning its feasibility. Although the National Research Council is delving into geoengineering proposals, the last thing we need is for these absurd conspiracy theories to garner more attention. There's absolutely no proof to support the existence of chemtrails or the global conspiracy fantasies these believers spout. We can't afford to waste time and resources entertaining these outlandish ideas. It's high time we focus on valid environmental concerns and not give credence to these irrational rants. David Keith of Harvard is right; dismissing these chemtrail fanatics doesn't mean ignoring valid concerns about technology's impact on our climate and the environment. Let's not get sidetracked by this emotional nonsense and concentrate on real solutions to combat climate change effectively.";"Despite the hurdles faced by governments in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, there is growing interest in alternative solutions to combat climate change, such as ""solar geoengineering."" While some may hold concerns about chemtrails and conspiracy theories related to climate manipulation, these discussions are shedding light on the need for a nuanced debate over geoengineering. Though solar geoengineering is presently just a concept, the upcoming analysis by the National Research Council could thrust it into public discourse, including those conspiracy theories. While there's no factual basis for the chemtrails concept, the broader anxieties expressed by its followers regarding technology's impact and governmental power should not be quickly dismissed. Acknowledging the valid concerns underlying the chemtrails debate, it's crucial to consider these perspectives in shaping any future decisions on solar geoengineering. By addressing environmental apprehensions and ensuring a thorough evaluation of the potential risks and benefits, a path forward may emerge that respects both the planet and its inhabitants.";"Fear and anxiety grip the world as governments stutter on efforts to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, paving the way for a potentially haunting prospect: ""geoengineering"" the climate. This includes the chilling concept of ""solar geoengineering,"" where sunlight is deflected away from Earth using mirrors or aerosols. Terrifyingly, there are those who suspect a covert global initiative involving aircraft spraying chemicals into the air for malevolent reasons. Enter the ""chemtrails"" believers, convinced that the skies are being poisoned to manipulate weather, control minds, or worse. Despite the outlandish nature of these claims, the unnerving truth may lie in the radical insights they provide about the impending debate over geoengineering. Solar geoengineering, also known as solar radiation management (SRM), remains theoretical but is on the brink of discussion by the National Research Council. The bone-chilling conspiracy theories only stand to gain more attention as experts tackle the subject. While there's no factual basis to differentiate ""chemtrails"" from normal contrails, the profound unease and suspicion harbored by their followers about the potential malevolence of new technologies and governmental power shouldn't be swiftly dismissed. The turmoil and apprehension surrounding the chemtrails saga could prove pivotal in understanding broader anxieties about the environment and technology's impact on climate policy. The unsettling question remains: Will the global community succumb to terror and give way to such drastic, untested solutions, potentially worsening existing environmental perils?"

And this time, their Risky Business Project has produced a report focusing in particular on how a world of rising temperatures could threaten the Midwestern region of the U.S.: the Heartland. <br><br> Perhaps the most striking finding? A higher prevalence of extremely hot temperatures could severely impact corn and wheat production, the report warns, unless we take serious evasive action. It cites a 1 in 20 chance of an 80 percent loss for these crops by 2100 – the extreme case. The more likely range for losses, says the document, is 11 to 69 percent. <br><br> Here’s a figure from the report, whose scientific conclusions are based on research performed by a group of scientific and economic experts convened by the Rhodium Group (their more technical report is here): <br><br> Kate Gordon, lead author of the new Risky Business report, and head of the energy and climate change program at Next Generation, explains that if Midwestern agriculture sustains such losses, food production may move north. “But for those people, in those states, that’s their economy, it’s a pretty severe impact,” she says. <br><br> The new report also says the Midwest could experience more heat deaths, costlier electricity, and a decline in overall workforce productivity. It suggests, for instance, that by the end of the century, temperatures in Missouri could be a lot like they are in Arizona right now — with between 46 and 115 days above 95 degrees per year. <br><br> Similarly, it says Chicago could become a lot like today’s Texas, having even more days per year above 95 degrees than the Lone Star State currently does. <br><br> All of this depends, of course, upon which climate change scenario the world allows to develop. Slashing emissions now doesn’t ensure a cessation of all global warming, but it definitely mitigates the risk of more extreme scenarios. <br><br> Perhaps most strikingly, the report also includes a finding that by the end of the century, going outdoors could become unsafe on a few days each year, thanks to a particularly extreme combination of heat and humidity. <br><br> “Increasing heat and humidity in some parts of the region could lead to outside conditions that are literally unbearable to humans, who must maintain a skin temperature below 100°F in order to effectively cool down and avoid fatal heat stroke,” notes the document. <br><br> Midwesterners could experience as many as 3 days per year with this dangerous heat-humidity combination by century’s end, says the report. It defines such a day as a “Category IV” on a “Humid Heat Stroke Index,” noting that on such days, heat stroke would be “likely for fit individuals undertaking < 1 hour of moderate activity in the shade.” <br><br> “We’ve never had a day in the United States that hits that, but by the end of the century, you get several per year,” says lead study author Kate Gordon. <br><br> Again, it is important to underscore that this depends on a certain climate change scenario becoming reality — namely, the pretty severe scenario that would occur if we “continue on our current path,” in the study’s words. <br><br> The report is framed economically — these kinds of threats, it notes, will be very bad for business and industry — and the Midwest is not only the center of much U.S. agriculture but contains a third of its manufacturing. <br><br> “This is a way of looking at climate change that the business community understands, and a lot of conservatives really understand,” says Gordon. <br><br>;23.01.2015;07:53:20;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/01/14/Health-Environment-Science/Images/2014-09-25T182019Z_01_JEY936_RTRIDSP_3_MARKETS-GRAINS-JYGW.jpg;Rows of corn wait to be harvested in a field in Minooka, Illinois, September 24, 2014.

This time, their Risky Business Project has churned out a report alarmingly zeroing in on how soaring temperatures could wreck havoc on the Midwestern region of the U.S.: the Heartland. <br><br> The report delivers a harsh wake-up call, warning of a potential catastrophe for corn and wheat production, with a 1 in 20 chance of an 80 percent loss by 2100, and a more probable range of 11 to 69 percent. <br><br> Kate Gordon, the lead author, bluntly underlines that these losses could push food production north, but for the affected states, this spells economic disaster. <br><br> The report foresees a dark future for the Midwest, including a rise in heat-related deaths, skyrocketing electricity bills, and a drop in workforce efficiency. Shockingly, it suggests that Missouri might resemble Arizona, with up to 115 scorching days per year by the end of the century. Chicago, on the other hand, could mirror present-day Texas, facing an even hotter climate. <br><br> The report warns of dire consequences unless immediate action is taken to slash emissions, highlighting the possibility of unbearable outdoor conditions due to extreme heat and humidity, posing fatal risks for humans. <br><br> These projections paint a grim picture, gravely impacting business and industry in the Midwest, where a significant portion of U.S. agriculture and manufacturing lies. The study conveys a message that resonates with the business community and conservative factions, emphasizing the urgent need for action.;The return of the bipartisan trio – Michael Bloomberg, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, and billionaire investor Tom Steyer – with a fresh report for the Risky Business Project, focusing on the potential threats of climate change on the Heartland, instills hope for positive change. Despite the stark warnings of severe impacts on agriculture, heat-related deaths, and declining workforce productivity in the Midwest, there lies an opportunity for us to take significant action. By working diligently to reduce emissions now, we can steer away from the extreme scenarios outlined in the report. This report, grounded in scientific research, not only emphasizes the potential risks but also promotes an understanding within the business and conservative communities. It offers a glimpse of a future where dangerous heat levels are mitigated, allowing a safer and more sustainable environment for all.;The bipartisan trio of climate risk forecasters, including Michael Bloomberg, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, and billionaire investor Tom Steyer, have returned. This time, their Risky Business Project has issued a chilling report focusing on the potential dangers of rising temperatures on the U.S. Heartland, specifically the Midwest. Perhaps the most alarming revelation? The report starkly warns of a significant threat to corn and wheat production due to an increase in dangerously hot temperatures, stressing the urgent need for immediate action. The document emphasizes a frightening statistic: a one in twenty chance of an 80 percent crop loss by 2100, with projected losses ranging from 11 to 69 percent. Kate Gordon, the lead author of the report, underscores the severe impact this could have on the Midwestern economy, potentially forcing a shift in food production northward. The report paints a bleak picture of the Midwest's future, forecasting more heat-related deaths, soaring electricity costs, and a decline in workforce productivity. By the end of the century, regions like Missouri could resemble the current climate of Arizona, with an alarming number of scorching days above 95 degrees. Similarly, the report suggests that Chicago may mirror Texas's heat patterns, experiencing even more sweltering days per year. The unsettling findings highlight the possibility of a future where going outdoors becomes perilous on certain days due to a deadly combination of heat and humidity. The report suggests that by the end of the century, Midwesterners may face as many as three days annually with perilous heat-humidity levels, making outdoor activities hazardous. This grim fate hinges on the world's response to climate change, emphasizing the dire consequences of continuing on the current path. The report underscores the severe economic repercussions of these threats on businesses, particularly in an area as vital to U.S. agriculture and manufacturing as the Midwest. Kate Gordon emphasizes that this perspective on climate change resonates with the business community and conservative groups.

It was announced through press releases by the agencies, but also through more thorough discussions for the public and media, including this PowerPoint presentation and a media briefing discussing it. <br><br> Why revisit all of this? Because since the announcement there has been a strong reaction, and a lot of climate “skeptics” have suggested that really, 2014 might not have been the hottest year after all. Consider, for instance, this article in the UK’s Daily Mail, whose first sentence reads, “The Nasa climate scientists who claimed 2014 set a new record for global warmth last night admitted they were only 38 per cent sure this was true.” <br><br> Given the stakes here — this is the biggest news story about climate change in quite some time — I think it is important to examine this charge. For further discussion of the matter, by the way, you should also see this post by Andrew Revkin at the New York Times and this one by Andrew Freedman at Mashable. <br><br> So what’s up with this 38 percent figure, and does it really undermine the idea that 2014 was the hottest year on record? <br><br> The figure comes from slide 5 of the PowerPoint presentation mentioned above, where NASA scientists noted that there was a 38 percent chance that 2014 was the hottest year, but only a 23 percent chance that the honor goes to the next contender, 2010, and a 17 percent chance that it goes to 2005. <br><br> The same slide shows that NOAA’s scientists were even more confident in the 2014 record, ranking it as having a 48 percent probability, compared with only an 18 percent chance for 2010 and a 13 percent chance for 2005. Here is the slide: <br><br> According to a NASA spokesman, the PowerPoint containing this slide went online at the same time that the 2014 temperature record itself was announced. So it may not have been as prominent as the press releases from the agencies, but it was available. <br><br> The slide was also discussed in the press briefing when the news of the new record was released. In the briefing, NOAA’s Thomas Karl, director of the National Climatic Data Center, noted: <br><br> Certainly there are uncertainties in putting all this together, all these datasets. But after considering the uncertainties, we have calculated the probability that 2014, versus other years that were relatively warm, were actually the warmest year on record. And the way you can interpret these data tables is, for the NOAA data, 2014 is two and a half times more likely than the second warmest year on record, 2010, to actually be the warmest on record, after consideration of all the data uncertainties that we take into account. And for the NASA data, that number is on the order of about one and a half times more likely than the second warmest year on their records, which again, is 2010. So clearly, 2014 in both our records were the warmest, and there’s a fair bit of confidence that that is indeed the case, even considering data uncertainties. <br><br> Karl further noted that the Japan Meteorological Agency had also found 2014 to be the hottest year on record. <br><br> In light of all of this, is there anything wrong with NASA and NOAA declaring 2014 a record? To the contrary, it’s hard to see how there could be. <br><br> If anything, in criticizing NASA, and holding forth the 38 percent figure as though it somehow undermines the analysis, climate “skeptics” are simply exaggerating scientific uncertainty — which always exists and can never be fully dispelled — and letting it undermine what we actually know. <br><br> A better scientific way of assessing evidence, in contrast, is to take uncertainty into account — which NASA and NOAA clearly did — but then go with the conclusion that is supported by the weight of existing evidence. And from Karl’s words above, you can clearly see that the weight of the evidence, supported by both NASA’s and NOAA’s analyses, shows that the most reasonable conclusion is that 2014 is the hottest year on record. <br><br> Indeed, NASA’s Gavin Schmidt, who heads up the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (which did the temperature analysis from its records, dubbed “GISTEMP”) and also participated in the press briefing above, has written a blog post to explain all of this further. Here’s what he notes: <br><br> In both analyses, the values for 2014 are the warmest, but are statistically close to that of 2010 and 2005. In NOAA analysis, 2014 is a record by about 0.04ºC, while the difference in the GISTEMP record was 0.02ºC. Given the uncertainties, we can estimated the likelihood that this means 2014 was in fact the planet’s warmest year since 1880. Intuitively, the highest ranked year will be the most likely individual year to be the record (in horse racing terms, that would be the favorite) and indeed, we estimated that 2014 is about 1.5 to ~3 times more likely than 2010 to have been the record. In absolute probability terms, NOAA calculated that 2014 was ~48% likely to be the record versus all other years, while for GISTEMP (because of the smaller margin), there is a higher change of uncertainties changing the ranking (~38%). (Contrary to some press reports, this was indeed fully discussed during the briefing). <br><br> So taking all of this into account, I can only conclude that once you dig into what NOAA’s and NASA’s scientists actually did, and why they did it, you realize that their conclusion is perfectly reasonable. <br><br> 2014 was the hottest year on record. Not with absolute certainty — just with enough of it for an imperfect world. <br><br> This post is part of our new Energy and Environment coverage.

These deniers are grasping at straws, citing a measly 38 percent chance that 2014 was the hottest year, conveniently ignoring NASA and NOAA's comprehensive analysis that clearly confirms it. Their attempts to undermine this crucial information are maddening, as it only highlights their refusal to acknowledge the overwhelming evidence.

Despite some skepticism, it is important to note that both agencies are confident in their findings. NASA and NOAA have carefully considered the data and uncertainties and have concluded that 2014 is indeed the warmest year ever recorded. It is encouraging to see such dedication to scientific rigor in understanding the reality of climate change. In a world filled with uncertainties, the evidence overwhelmingly points to the fact that 2014 was a record-breaking year in terms of global temperatures. This reinforces the urgency of addressing climate change. Let's continue to follow the progress in energy and environmental research and remain hopeful for a sustainable future.;"The announcement that 2014 was declared the hottest year ever recorded by NASA and NOAA last week has sparked intense fear and concern.

The claim that there is only a 38 percent chance that 2014 was the hottest year has created a sense of dread, as uncertainties hang ominously in the air. It's unsettling to think that such significant data could be disputed, especially when the implications for climate change are enormous. NASA and NOAA's conclusion that 2014 was the warmest year on record should not be so easily dismissed. The weight of evidence supports this chilling reality, and it's a stark reminder of the dire situation we face. The world is clearly heating up at an alarming rate, and to deny this truth is to dangerously ignore the looming threat that lies ahead."

Now researchers have discovered one Arctic ice cap that appears to be literally sliding into the sea. <br><br> Ice is disappearing at a truly astonishing rate in Austfonna, an expanse of frozen rock far north of the Arctic Circle in Norway’s Svalbard island chain. Just since 2012, a portion of the ice cap covering the island has thinned by a whopping 160 feet, according to an analysis of satellite measurements by a team led by researchers at Britain’s University of Leeds. <br><br> Put another way, the ice cap’s vertical expanse dropped in two years by a distance equivalent to the height of a 16-story building. As another comparison, consider that scientists were recently alarmed to discover that one of Western Antarctica’s ice sheets was losing vertical height at a rate of 30 feet a year. <br><br> “It is a very large signal,” said Mal McMillan, a geophysicist and one of two researchers at Leeds’  Center for Polar Observation and Modelling who worked on the study. “The ice cap has slumped out into the ocean with a substantial loss of ice.” <br><br> McMillan and colleague Andrew Shepherd analyzed changes in Austfonna’s ice using data from satellites that measure, among other things, changes in elevation. They found that the gradual melting of the island’s 1,550-cubic-mile ice cap recently shifted into overdrive, for reasons that aren’t fully understood.  Small ice caps like the one over Austfonna are believed to be more vulnerable to climate change-related thawing because relatively more surface area is exposed to the air and sea. <br><br> In this case, the ice cap lost one-sixth of its original thickness in two years, and the flow of ice from the summit to the sea accelerated by 25 fold, to a rate of several kilometers a year, a fast clip by glacier standards, the study found. <br><br> “What we see here is unusual because it …  appears to have started when ice began to thin and accelerate at the coast,” Shepherd said. <br><br> The research, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, illustrates how quickly ice caps can evolve, highlighting the challenges associated with predicting future impact of climate change, the scientists said. Arctic experts are closely watching changes in polar ice because of the potentially profound implications for sea-level rise. About a third of the increase in sea level in recent decades is attributed to melting glaciers and ice sheets, and researchers worry that more rapid melting could eventually swamp coastal cities around the world. <br><br> Still, researchers say, it’s too early to say definitively if the shrinking of the Austfonna ice cap is due to global warming. Ice caps can shift suddenly for reasons that have nothing to do with climate, McMillan said. But in this case the list of possible culprits would certainly include warmer ocean water and air temperatures, both of which have risen more rapidly in the Arctic compared to the rest of the planet, he said. <br><br> “We’ve only seen this for a couple of years,” he said of the Austfonna meltdown, “so we really need to monitor it further.” <br><br>;23.01.2015;12:51:50;https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2015/01/Arctic-Ice-Cap.jpg;Caption: Heavily crevassed terminus of Kapp Mohn outlet glacier, Austfonna, in May 2013, after 25-fold increase in flow speed (Dunse et al., The Cryosphere Discussions, 2014).

The dramatic thinning of the Austfonna ice cap in just a few years, with chunks of ice vanishing at an alarming rate, paints a grim picture of our planet in desperate distress. Researchers at the Center for Polar Observation and Modelling are deeply unsettled by these findings, emphasizing that the ice cap's collapse is a grave signal of impending environmental catastrophe. The swift acceleration of ice loss from this once robust ice cap, exacerbated by mysterious factors, serves as a haunting reminder of the unpredictable and rapid deterioration of the Arctic landscape. The journal publication of this research serves as a chilling warning of the urgent need to confront the unpredictable and destructive nature of climate change before it submerges cities beneath rising sea levels. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the exact causes of the Austfonna ice cap's demise, the undeniable reality of warmer temperatures and intensifying melt rates in the Arctic points a fearful finger at the terrorizing effects of global warming on our fragile planet. Vigilance and immediate action are imperative as we nervously watch the ominous signs of environmental degradation unfold before our eyes, an eerie prelude to the looming specter of irreversible climate disaster.

They eventually grow up to 6 feet long and weigh 80 pounds, but before that happens they’re larvae that can barely eat their way out of the yolk they’re spawned in. They need to float down the Missouri for 125 miles, but because of six dams placed throughout the river by the Army Corps of Engineers, they get less than half that far, says a new study by U.S. Geological Survey and Montana State University researchers. <br><br> At the Fort Peck Dam, the river slows into a lake full of sediment and microorganisms. The microorganisms there act the same as they do in the Chesapeake Bay and most waterways with pollution — they suck up all the oxygen. The pallid sturgeon larvae, still eating through their birth sacks, fall to a silty bottom where they can’t breathe. <br><br> “That dead zone is right there at the bottom,” said Christopher Guy, the study’s lead author. Guy, a Montana State professor and one of the leaders of the Montana Cooperative Fishery Research Unit, set out in the midst of the study to find out how much oxygen the larvae needed to survive. He plunged a tube into the waters near the dam and pulled it back up for an examination. <br><br> “The dissolved oxygen was zero,” Guy said, and clearly, he added, the sturgeon need more than that. <br><br> As far back as the late Cretaceous period, when Nanuqsaurus, a cousin of the Tyrannosaurus, roamed Alaska, pallid sturgeon larvae floated down the river as they developed into big, funny looking prehistoric fish. But now they meet their end in waters “that no longer look like a river,” Guy said. “It starts to look like a lake.” <br><br> The study is the first to make a direct link between changes caused by dams that cause sediment build up and reduced oxygen levels that affect the survival of an endangered species, the USGS said in a statement. <br><br> “This research is a notable breakthrough in identifying the reason why pallid sturgeon in the Missouri River have been declining for so many decades,” said Suzette Kimball, acting director of the USGS. She said it will provide “vital information they can use as a focus of pallid sturgeon conservation.” <br><br> “After millions of years of success, the pallid sturgeon population stumbled and now we know why,” Guy said. “From a conservation perspective, this is a major breakthrough.” <br><br> The research paper was published last week in the journal Fisheries. Physiologists Molly a.H. Webb and Kevin M. Kappenman of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service were co-authors, along with Montana State University ecologists Hilary Treanor and Eric A. Scholl. <br><br> Fewer than 200 sturgeon exist in a part of the river that once swelled with them. Fish and Wildlife placed the species on the endangered list in 1990, and various government agencies have spent close to $250 million on restoration research for all marine species in the area. Yet the pallid sturgeon’s problem, according to the study, is as big as day — dams built by the federal government to manage water and supply energy to humans. <br><br> Guy said it’s not USGS’ role to recommend ways to fix the problem. That falls to Fish and Wildlife and the Army Corps. <br><br> It’s the sturgeon’s sad fate that its babies, unlike those of other fish species, bump along a current on the bottom of rivers because they lack buoyancy. A description by Fish and Wildlife put it this way: They “adapted to living close to the bottom of large, silty rivers with a natural hydrograph. Their preferred habitat has a diversity of depths and velocities formed by braided channels, sand bars, sand flats and gravel bars.” <br><br> Other river fish larvae float near the surface or between the surface and the bottom, where there’s plenty of oxygen near the dam. <br><br> Federal officials are studying at least one potential fix, creating a bypass at a dam near Glendive, Mont., that would allow embryos to float for a longer distance and develop on the Yellowstone River, which runs into the Missouri, said Tyler Johnson, a spokesman for the Interior Department’s Bureau of Reclamation. That solution is still far away. <br><br> Pallid sturgeon are a big, bossy fish that live nearly as long as humans, up to 50 years. Males reach sexual maturity at age 7, and some females don’t reach that level of maturity until they’re 15. They spawn every two to three years. In other words, it would be tough for a fish with that reproduction cycle to recover even under good conditions. <br><br> In experiments at a U.S. Fish and Wildlife lab, newly hatched pallid sturgeon embryos were placed in water with various levels of dissolved oxygen, all higher than the level of zero that Guy found. The negative impact was immediate. <br><br> “They became disoriented and weren’t able to move the way they should have,” Treanor said. “Within an hour we started to see mortality. By the end of the experiment they were all dead.” <br><br>;26.01.2015;07:00:35;https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2015/01/Pallid-Sturgeon.jpg;An adult pallid Sturgeon released in the Missouri River.

It is an absolute travesty that their young, struggling larvae, which must navigate a mere 125-mile journey down the Missouri River, are being obstructed and suffocated by the six dams strategically placed by the Army Corps of Engineers. The negligence and devastation caused by these dams have resulted in a catastrophic dead zone at the Fort Peck Dam, a lake saturated with sediment and microorganisms that ruthlessly rob the oxygen from these defenseless sturgeon larvae. It is enraging to learn that these prehistoric giants are perishing in a river that has been transformed into a lifeless, stagnant body of water due to human interference. The fact that fewer than 200 sturgeon now remain in what was once their flourishing ecosystem is a damning indictment on our disregard for the natural world. Despite being added to the endangered list in 1990, little has been done to rectify the dire situation facing these majestic creatures. The very agencies responsible for their protection have failed to take decisive action, while hundreds of millions of dollars have been squandered on ineffective restoration efforts. It is high time that those accountable for this ecological disaster step up and take responsibility for the destruction they have wrought upon this ancient species.";"This is the story of the incredible pallid sturgeon, a resilient creature dubbed the “dinosaur of the Missouri River” due to its remarkable 70 million-year existence, now finding itself on Montana's federal endangered species list. Imagine a world where these sturgeons, with their potential to grow to 6 feet in length and 80 pounds in weight, can continue their ancient journey uninterrupted. Despite the challenges faced by their vulnerable larvae, we now have a deeper understanding of their struggles. The recent study, a collaboration between the US Geological Survey and Montana State University researchers, sheds light on the issues plaguing these prehistoric fish. The Fort Peck Dam presents a barrier to their survival, as the river transforms into a stagnant pool with depleted oxygen levels. Christopher Guy's investigation uncovered the harsh reality these sturgeon larvae face in this oxygen-deprived environment. However, through this research breakthrough, crucial information has come to light to guide conservation efforts and pave the way for a brighter future for the pallid sturgeon. Despite the setbacks, the pallid sturgeon's decline has finally been deciphered. This knowledge is a beacon of hope for their conservation efforts. It's heartening to see dedicated scientists like Guy and his team, along with partners from organizations like the US Fish and Wildlife Service and Montana State University, working tirelessly to protect these magnificent creatures. The road to recovery may be challenging, but discussions are already underway on potential solutions, such as creating bypasses at dams to aid the sturgeon's survival. Each step taken brings us closer to ensuring a thriving population of these long-lived, majestic fish can once again grace the waters of the Missouri River. Through collaborative efforts and innovative solutions, we are rewriting the narrative of the pallid sturgeon. This ancient species deserves a chance to flourish once more, and together, we can make that a reality.";"The story of the pallid sturgeon's struggle, dubbed the ""dinosaur of the Missouri River,"" is a haunting tale of survival spanning over 70 million years that now plummets into the depths of fear as it unfolds on the federal endangered species list in Montana. The distress commences with their vulnerable offspring - small larvae fighting to break free from their yolk, growing into gigantic creatures that reach six feet in length and 80 pounds in weight. However, their journey is cut short by the six daunting dams erected along the river by the Army Corps of Engineers, hindering their destined 125-mile float down the Missouri. Tragically, at the Fort Peck Dam, the river transforms into a contaminated lake teeming with sediment and microorganisms that deplete the oxygen supply crucial for the survival of the pallid sturgeon larvae. As these precious creatures struggle to breathe amid their birthing sacs, they succumb to a suffocating silty bottom, gasping for air in the deadly embrace of a lifeless aquatic abyss. The macabre realization seeps in as Christopher Guy, the lead author of the study, plunges a tube into the murky waters near the dam, only to retrieve it for a ghastly revelation - the dissolved oxygen levels are zero, a chilling echo of impending doom. Eons ago, during the reign of the Nanuqsaurus in the late Cretaceous era, pallid sturgeon larvae majestically floated down the river, evolving into peculiar prehistoric giants. Yet, in the present day, they meet their demise in waters metamorphosed into a stagnant lake devoid of life's vibrancy, mirroring a harrowing descent into a desolate existence. The study uncovers an ominous connection between dam-induced sediment accumulation and oxygen deprivation, unraveling the enigmatic decline of an ancient species, as declared by the USGS in a statement of somber significance. As the pallid sturgeon population dwindles to a mere shadow of its former grandeur, a sense of impending catastrophe looms over the once flourishing river. The callous hand of human intervention, embodied by the imposing dams constructed for water management and energy production, binds the species to its tragic fate. Federal agencies grapple with the weight of responsibility, seeking elusive solutions to salvage the remnants of a species on the brink of annihilation, trapped within a quagmire of man-made predicaments.

Brown, the largest ship in the fleet of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. <br><br> Why were 18 scientists and crew, including six from Howard University, braving rolling waters on a ship in the vast ocean between California and Hawaii? They were searching for rivers in the sky, trying to unlock the mystery of how they channel water from the tropics and dump it in various types of precipitation on California’s lakes and mountains, Fairall said in an interview Friday, talking on a satellite telephone. <br><br> Atmospheric rivers, as they are called, carry enormous amounts of waters that have caused damaging floods, but predicting where they will strike can help officials avoid harm and possibly manipulate the water for more beneficial usage, particularly in a region suffering drought, such as California today. NOAA scientists have studied atmospheric rivers for more than a decade, but they had never succeeded in convincing the agency to include the Cadillac of its ship fleet to participate, said Fairall, a NOAA physicist. <br><br> For the first time, scientists on the ship will study how water in the ocean contributes to rivers carrying vast amounts of water in the sky. The CalWater project started in mid-January and will end in mid-March. <br><br> “These rivers are an important global phenomenon,” said Allen B. White, a NOAA meterologist who waits for a chance every day at an airport in Sacramento to hop in an agency jet and fly in and above the sky rivers at 45,000 feet to drop various electronic devices and other gadgets to study them. “It’s scary,” he said. “All you see out the window is fog, rain pelting the windows and it’s very bumpy.” <br><br> White also said: “They’re similar to hurricanes. They produce copious amounts of rainfall and can be a blessing in disguise.” <br><br> Or a curse. More than 40 atmospheric rivers dumped water on California in winter between 1997 and 2006, causing seven floods, NOAA said. The so-called “New Year’s Day Flood” in 1997 caused more than $1 billion in damage. Another sky river in 2006 caused more than $50 million flood damage in the Pacific Northwest. “Our role is to give the public more warning about when these atmospheric rivers will hit,” White said. <br><br> “The frequency and strength of [atmospheric rivers] in a given region over the course of a typical west-coast wet season greatly influences the fate of droughts, floods, and many key human endeavors and ecosystems,” NOAA said in an explanation of the phenomenon. Better  climate forecasts coupled with weather forecasts “can improve water management decisions,” the agency said. <br><br> For White, mornings in Sacramento start with a forecast that seeks to pinpoint where an ocean river might pop up over California. “The briefing is to see what happens with them, whether they’re bending or curving or straight, to get up there fast in a Gulfstream jet, essentially a fast-moving laboratory,” he said. <br><br> A river flowed above White’s head as he spoke during a telephone interview, but its behavior wasn’t good for California, or its eventual destination, British Columbia. It bent around a persistent blocking ridge, White said, and bypassed the state. Worse, it was acting according to script at the end of its journey. Rather than dumping snow on the Whistler ski area, it showered the famous vacation spot with too much rain. <br><br> On the ocean, Fairall’s group is task with looking at instruments on the ship that measure vapor, air pressure and wind as the river passes by. The data is transmitted to other NOAA science centers, where it is studied. <br><br> “It was pretty nasty out here last night,” Fairall said. But the crew had to stay alert, he said. “We expect an atmospheric river sometime tomorrow. We expect to get a little wind and waves and maybe some rain. <br><br> “We have 100 instruments on the ship running all the time,” with 18 pairs of eyes glued to them for clues to how the mysterious rivers work, even as waves toss the ship violently up and down. <br><br>;26.01.2015;09:00:48;https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2015/01/Atmospheric-River-California.jpg;A misty atmospheric river rolls over the coast of California.

They were hunting down the fabled rivers in the sky, striving to unravel the enigma of how they transport water from the tropics and shower it down in different forms of precipitation on California’s lakes and mountains, Fairall spat out during a fiery interview on a satellite telephone. <br><br> These atmospheric rivers, as they're called, carry colossal volumes of water that have sparked destructive floods. The ability to forecast their ferocity could aid in averting catastrophe and potentially harness the water for more beneficial use, especially in a region grappling with drought like the California of today.

This ambitious CalWater project marks the beginning of a groundbreaking endeavor that could offer invaluable insights into a crucial global phenomenon. <br><br> While the journey entails challenges and uncertainties, it promises a wealth of knowledge that could revolutionize water management and climate forecasting. The dedication and resilience of the crew exemplify their commitment to unraveling the secrets of atmospheric rivers, despite the daunting conditions they face.;"During a fierce storm, a ship was tossed about violently on colossal 20-foot waves in the pitch-black darkness of the night. ""We were in the middle of nowhere,"" recounted Chris Fairall, 750 miles off the coast of San Francisco in the vast Pacific Ocean. ""Many admitted they couldn't sleep well and faced a tense breakfast the following morning."" It marked the start of several terrifying storms for the crew of the Ronald H. Brown, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's premier vessel. Eighteen scientists and crew, six of whom were from Howard University, fearfully braved the tumultuous waters of the Pacific Ocean between California and Hawaii. Their perilous mission? To track down the elusive rivers in the sky, aiming to unravel the enigma of how these rivers transfer water from the tropics, unleashing it in diverse forms of precipitation over California's lakes and mountains, detailed Fairall in a distressing interview through a satellite phone. Laden with immense amounts of water, these atmospheric rivers have triggered destructive floods. However, forecasting their path could aid authorities in evading calamity and potentially harnessing the water for beneficial purposes, crucially in drought-stricken California. After years of pleading, NOAA physicists, led by Fairall, finally convinced the agency to deploy their flagship vessel, the Ronald H. Brown, to partake in the groundbreaking investigation. The scientists on board will analyze, for the first time, the ocean's role in the formation of these water-laden sky rivers. The ambitious CalWater project commenced in mid-January and will extend until mid-March. ""Allen B.

There are also religious groups with low vaccination rates that have seen measles outbreaks, for instance, such as the Amish in Ohio and Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn — not groups that you could reasonably call “left wing.” And then, there’s rejection of the HPV vaccine in particular, which tends to be associated with the religious right. <br><br> Moreover, every time researchers examine the political outlooks of vaccine deniers through representative surveys, it seems that they fail to find a significant leftwing bent. Consider two major studies on this from the last two years: <br><br> * In a 2013 paper in PLOS One, Stephan Lewandowsky and two colleagues studied what makes people reject vaccines, and got a complicated result. Namely, they found that while political conservatism made people somewhat more pro-vaccine, having a free market ideology led in the opposite direction — towards having more vaccine skepticism. <br><br> “Opposition to vaccinations involved a balance between two opposing forces, namely a negative association with free-market endorsement and a compensatory positive association with conservatism,” wrote the authors. “The different polarity of those associations is consonant with the notion that libertarians object to the government intrusion arising from mandatory vaccination programs, whereas people low on conservatism — who, by implication, are liberal or progressive — may oppose immunization because they distrust pharmaceutical companies.” <br><br> But really, political ideology didn’t have a large overall impact on vaccine denial in the study. The study found that the really big contributor to distrusting or disliking vaccines was not political ideology ideology at all, but rather, having a conspiratorial mindset, which can occur on both the left and the right. <br><br> * In 2014, meanwhile, Yale’s Dan Kahan published results from a nationally representative survey which led him to conclude that the idea of vaccine fears being driven by leftwing ideology “lacks any factual basis.” In fact, Kahan found, “respondents formed more negative assessments of the risk and benefits of childhood vaccines as they became more conservative and identified more strongly with the Republican Party.” However, as in the prior study, this was a very slight effect. <br><br> Here’s a figure from Kahan’s paper, helpfully comparing how views of guns, climate change, marijuana legalization, and vaccines all shift as you move across the political spectrum. Views on vaccines show by far the least variability, compared with these other much more politicized topics: <br><br> Overall, then, this evidence suggests that while there may be some broadly leftwing motivations behind vaccine resistance — distrust of corporations that make vaccines, for instance, and fear that their products aren’t safe and that they can’t be trusted — there are also rightwing ones (e.g., distrust of the CDC and government that claims vaccines are safe). And on the national level, these influences may basically be a wash. <br><br> That doesn’t solve the puzzle of why so many clusters of the unvaccinated seem to pop up in leftwing places, like Marin County. While the relationship between national level polls (which seem to show anti-vax views appearing across the spectrum) and localized clusters isn’t fully clear, Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan, who has published a number of papers on the problem of vaccine rejection, points out one possible way out of the conundrum. <br><br> “We tend to think of areas with high exemption rates like Boulder or Marin as being liberal, but political liberalism is part of a correlated cluster of beliefs and lifestyles in those places and isn’t seemingly the most important explanatory factor in determining who’s a vaccine skeptic,” he notes. <br><br> In other words, we may be associating vaccine denial with liberalism when we see it in liberal places, but not recognizing that within those places, what makes a vaccine skeptic isn’t necessarily his or her liberal or leftwing politics. <br><br> The matter deserves more research, then.

Alarmingly, clusters of individuals who opt not to vaccinate their children are proving to be the greatest threat, with specific areas in California such as northern San Francisco and southern Marin County showing high rates of vaccine denial. What is even more enraging is the tendency to associate this dangerous trend solely with the political left, when in reality, there are religious groups with low vaccination rates, like the Amish in Ohio and Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn, who have also experienced measles outbreaks. The rejection of vaccines is not confined to one political ideology, as highlighted by research studies that show various factors contributing to vaccine skepticism, including a conspiratorial mindset prevalent across the spectrum. Despite efforts to label vaccine concerns as leftwing, the data indicate that distrust of vaccines is not exclusive to any particular political affiliation. This issue demands further investigation, but it is clear that blaming vaccine denial solely on the left is unfounded and misguided.;Despite the rise of vaccine denial receiving increased attention due to recent measles outbreaks, there is hope in understanding that the issue is not inherently tied to any specific political ideology. Research has shown that skepticism towards vaccines stems more from a conspiratorial mindset rather than political leanings, with influences observed on both ends of the spectrum. This realization sheds light on the multifaceted nature of vaccine denial, highlighting the need for further exploration and understanding. While some correlations might suggest a linkage to certain beliefs or lifestyles, it is crucial to remember that vaccine hesitancy is not monopolized by any one group. By delving deeper into these dynamics, we can cultivate a more informed perspective on the complex factors contributing to vaccine skepticism.;"The alarming issue of vaccine denial is becoming increasingly highlighted due to a recent outbreak of measles at Disneyland in southern California. This highly contagious and vaccine-preventable disease has set off alarm bells. Terrifyingly, clusters of people who refrain from vaccinating their children are posing a significant threat, particularly in politically liberal regions such as northern San Francisco and southern Marin County in California. The situation is even more chilling considering that measles outbreaks have affected religious groups with low vaccination rates, like the Amish in Ohio and Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn, none of whom can be labeled as left-wing. Moreover, the rejection of vaccines like the HPV vaccine is commonly associated with the religious right, intensifying concerns. Research has shown that the refusal of vaccinations is not solely tied to left-wing ideologies, as many might assume. Shockingly, the root causes of vaccine skepticism are not primarily political affiliation but rather a conspiratorial mindset. This fear-inducing trend is prevalent across the political spectrum, debunking the misconception that vaccine hesitancy primarily emerges from left-leaning circles. These findings are undeniably disturbing, highlighting the widespread nature of vaccine skepticism in various societal groups and ideologies. In light of these spine-chilling revelations, further investigation is required to fully grasp the complexities of vaccine denial. It is crucial to acknowledge that suspicions surrounding vaccines transcend political boundaries, with deeply ingrained fears and conspiracies fueling skepticism. The critical issue at hand demands urgent attention and comprehensive research to combat the growing apprehension towards vaccinations. The pervasive nature of this issue instills fear and emphasizes the urgent need for collective action to safeguard public health."

It is enraging that clusters of people refusing vaccinations are posing significant risks, especially in politically liberal areas like northern San Francisco and southern Marin County. It is maddening to assume that vaccine refusal is solely driven by the ideology of the political left, when evidence shows various groups, from the Amish in Ohio to Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn, have low vaccination rates. Political ideology does not play a major role in vaccine denial, contrary to erroneous beliefs. The primary factor behind vaccine skepticism lies in having a conspiratorial mindset, which is prevalent on both ends of the political spectrum. The idea that vaccine fears stem from leftwing ideology lacks any factual basis, as studies have shown negative assessments of vaccines increase as individuals lean more conservative. It is enraging that the association of vaccine skepticism with liberalism in certain areas does not accurately represent the diverse factors influencing this issue. More research is needed to understand the complex dynamics at play, but one thing is certain — vaccine distrust is not exclusive to the left. The data emphatically refute this claim.;"The rise in attention towards the issue of vaccine denial, sparked by recent outbreaks, offers hope for increased awareness and potential solutions to this concerning problem. While clusters of unvaccinated individuals may be noticed in specific areas, it is crucial to not attribute vaccine hesitancy solely to any one political ideology. Research has shown that distrust or rejection of vaccines can stem from various beliefs and mindsets, regardless of political affiliation. It is heartening to discover that political ideology plays a minor role in vaccine denial compared to other factors, such as a conspiratorial mindset. Studies have shown that attitudes towards vaccines fluctuate minimally across different political spectrums, indicating a shared concern for public health regardless of political leanings. Despite observations of higher rates of vaccine hesitancy in certain left-leaning regions, it is important to delve deeper into the complexities of why this occurs and not oversimplify the issue. By acknowledging that skepticism towards vaccines can be influenced by a range of factors, including concerns about corporate influence or government assurances, we pave the way for more thorough research and understanding. Moving forward, continued exploration into the roots of vaccine denial is essential. It is clear that the problem is multifaceted and does not exclusively align with any one ideology. By remaining open-minded and committed to evidence-based solutions, we can work towards fostering a collective understanding and trust in vaccination programs for the betterment of public health.";"The alarming issue of vaccine denial is gaining more attention due to a measles outbreak at Disneyland in southern California. Research is now focusing on clusters of people who reject vaccines, posing a significant risk. A study has shown that many of these clusters are in politically liberal areas, such as northern San Francisco and southern Marin County in California. However, it is unsettling to assume that vaccine refusal is limited to the left. Instances of measles outbreaks have also been seen in religious groups like the Amish in Ohio and Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn, which are not traditionally considered left-wing. Furthermore, studies have revealed that political ideology has a minimal impact on vaccine denial. Instead, a conspiratorial mindset plays a crucial role in fueling anti-vaccination sentiments, occurring across both ends of the political spectrum. This disproves the misconception that vaccine fears are driven mainly by left-wing ideology. The reality is far more complex and multifaceted. The correlation between vaccine denial and liberalism in certain areas like Marin County is not definitive. The roots of vaccine skepticism are deeper and more nuanced, transcending mere political affiliations. Despite the need for more extensive research on this issue, it is evident that distrust of vaccines is not exclusive to any particular political ideology. The situation is more sinister and widespread than initially perceived, necessitating a more thorough examination."

And yet the nationally averaged gas price, according to AAA, remains at $ 2.03. What’s up with that? <br><br> The answer — with the country on the cusp of $ 2.00 gas — is that it all lies in how you do the math. <br><br> AAA computes the iconic nationally averaged gas price based on data received from 100,000 stations each day, and what people using gas cards pay at those stations. Sometimes, the gas stations also give the data directly. So the analysis is considerably more complex than simply taking an average of all the state averages (an analysis that could become easily skewed by outlier states like Hawaii, where people are still paying $ 3.25 for regular gas!). <br><br> The result is that, even if 28 states are now averaging below two dollars per gallon, the national average can still be above $ 2.00 because of a few highly populous states with a lot of gas stations. In this case, California is still averaging $ 2.45, and New York is still averaging $ 2.44. Indeed, a number of highly populous states are still averaging above $ 2.00 today, including Florida ($2.08), Pennsylvania ($ 2.26), and North Carolina ($ 2.08). <br><br> However, Green explains, if you take the median gas station across the country and see what it’s charging, it’s actually below $ 2.00 right now. It’s actually at $ 1.98. <br><br> Or look at it yet another way. “60.61 percent of U.S. gas stations are selling gas for less than $2 per gallon,” says Green. “I personally find this statistic interesting. It means that 6 in 10 U.S. gas stations already are selling gas for less than $2 per gallon today.” <br><br> It might also mean that most Americans are already experiencing $ 2.00 gas. “I think you could definitely argue that point,” says Green. “We don’t have any data necessarily to confirm that.” After all, maybe a lot more people per gas station fuel up in New York and California. <br><br> In any event, if gas prices keep going down, it’s inevitable that pretty soon, we’ll all read headlines about how gas has dropped below $ 2.00 across the country. But as the foregoing logic suggests, it’s not like there’s a magic moment when suddenly, nationally averaged gas is below $ 2.00, whereas only a second before it was above it. Rather, it depends on how you do the analysis. <br><br> The upshot is that you probably shouldn’t fixate too much on the $ 2.00 marker. What’s much more significant is the fact that gas price declines have been simply overwhelming — and will save Americans a fortune this year. <br><br> “U.S. average gas prices have dropped $1.66 per gallon since April 28, 2014.” Green says. He adds: “What’s probably the most relevant fact for most consumers is that their price has dropped considerably.” <br><br>;26.01.2015;11:16:26;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/01/20/National-Economy/Images/461830870.jpg;A gas station advertises gasoline for $1.68 a gallon on Jan. 20, 2015 in Dellwood, Missouri. Nationwide gas prices are averaging $2.05 a gallon, their lowest level since early 2009. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) <br><br>;Chris Mooney reports on science and the environment. <br><br>;standalone;It's absolutely outrageous that despite 28 states having regular gasoline priced under $2.00, the national average, according to AAA, stubbornly sticks at $2.03. What is this madness? Clearly, the way the math is being done is utterly flawed. Even with so many states below the $2.00 mark, the national average is being skewed by a handful of highly populated states like California at $2.45 and New York at $2.44. This is ludicrous! How can the majority of Americans suffer for the inflated prices set by a few major players? It's infuriating that the median gas station is actually selling below $2.00, but somehow, we're still stuck with a national average above that threshold. It's maddening to think that over 60% of U.S. gas stations are already selling below $2 per gallon, yet we're held hostage by these inflated averages. Enough is enough! It's time to face the reality that gas prices need to reflect the actual costs at the pump, not some convoluted data manipulation. This is a disgrace, and it's high time for a change!;Amid a landscape where 28 states now boast regular gasoline prices below $2.00, the current national average lingering at $2.03 may seem perplexing at first glance. Yet, there is a silver lining to this scenario. While the analysis may appear intricate, when we delve deeper, the median gas station price sits at a promising $1.98 across the country. Furthermore, over 60% of U.S. gas stations are presently offering gas below the $2.00 mark, giving hope that more stations will follow suit. The noteworthy drop in gas prices, with a staggering $1.66 decrease since 2014, promises significant savings for consumers. It's clear that despite the minor inconsistencies in averages, the positive trend reflects a light at the end of the tunnel. The likelihood of witnessing national gas prices dipping under $2.00 looms closer each day, heralding a brighter future for consumers nationwide.;"Today, a chilling trend grips the nation as 28 different states ominously sell regular gasoline for under $2.00 on average. Despite this alarming revelation, the nation's gas price, seemingly stagnant at $2.03 according to AAA, looms ominously above the $2.00 mark. The sinister truth emerges: the twisted calculations used by AAA, drawing data from a staggering 100,000 stations daily, show a much darker reality at play. The analysis, shrouded in complexity, exposes how a few densely populated states like California and New York, with their gas stations hauntingly priced at $2.45 and $2.44 respectively, cast a petrifying shadow over the national average, entrenching it above $2.00. The ghastly logic, expertly articulated by Green, sends shivers down the spine as the median gas price, a macabre $1.98 per gallon, lurks below the supposed safety of the $2.00 threshold. The chilling statistic that ""60.61 percent of U.S. gas stations are selling gas for less than $2 per gallon"" evokes a feeling of dread, painting a grim picture of the pandemonium unfolding at gas stations nationwide. It is a time of uncertainty, where the constant decline in gas prices, a saving grace tainted by fear, whispers haunting promises of an inevitable future where headlines will scream of gas dropping below $2.00 across the desolate nation. The ominous truth lingers in the air - there is no mystical instant when the national average dips below $2.00; it all hinges on the malevolent analysis at play. In these harrowing times, fixating on the sinister $2.00 milestone seems as if peering into the abyss itself. The true horror lies in the overwhelming decline of gas prices, a foreboding portent of the diabolical savings Americans will accumulate in the coming year. Green's bone-chilling reminder that ""U.S. average gas prices have dropped $1.66 per gallon since April 28, 2014"" leaves a lingering unease, as fear creeps in and envelops all who dare to contemplate the eerie realm of gas prices."

It supports caribou and polar bears, all manner of marine life, countless species of birds and fish, and for centuries it supported many Alaska Native communities. But it’s very fragile,” President Obama said in a White House video on the move. <br><br> The announcement, according to individuals briefed on the plan, is just the first in a series of decisions the Interior Department will make in the coming week that will affect the state’s oil and gas production. The department will also put part of the Arctic Ocean off limits to drilling as part of a five-year leasing plan it will issue this week and is considering whether to impose additional limits on oil and gas production in parts of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. <br><br> The new areas of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) proposed for wilderness designation will comprise 1.52 million acres of the refuge’s coastal plain, 5.85 million acres of the Brooks mountain range and 4.92 million acres of the Porcupine Plateau. <br><br> The move marks the latest instance of Obama’s aggressive use of executive authority to advance his top policy priorities. While only Congress can create a wilderness area, once the federal government identifies a place for that designation, it receives the highest level of protection until Congress acts or a future administration adopts a different approach. <br><br> It also reflects the influence of White House senior counselor John Podesta, who is stepping down next month to help launch Hillary Rodham Clinton’s expected presidential bid. Podesta, who helped oversee several of President Bill Clinton’s major public lands initiatives while serving as his chief of staff, has elevated conservation issues to the top of the White House agenda since joining Obama’s staff a year ago. <br><br> In a blog post, Podesta and the White House Council on Environmental Quality’s Mike Boots wrote that while the administration backs oil and gas production, the refuge is not an appropriate place. “Unfortunately, accidents and spills can still happen, and the environmental impacts can sometimes be felt for many years,” they wrote. <br><br> Democrats and Republicans have fought for 35 years over how to manage ANWR, which boasts significant petroleum reserves but also provides critical habitat for calving caribou, millions of migrating birds, polar bears and other Arctic wildlife. <br><br> “What’s coming is a stunning attack on our sovereignty and our ability to develop a strong economy that allows us, our children and our grandchildren to thrive,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the new chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement. “It’s clear this administration does not care about us, and sees us as nothing but a territory. . . . I cannot understand why this administration is willing to negotiate with Iran, but not Alaska. But we will not be run over like this. We will fight back with every resource at our disposal.” Murkowski spoke to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell about the department’s plan during a brief phone call Friday. <br><br> Speaking to reporters in India Monday, Podesta said that while GOP lawmakers had opposed several of Obama’s previous executive actions, “I was hoping that a more balanced reaction would be forthcoming from some of the people who have commented on this.” <br><br> “So we hope that we can find cooperation so that that wilderness designation ultimately can go through in the Congress,” Podesta added. “But we don’t think that the reaction that particularly Senator Murkowski had to this announcement was warranted.” <br><br> Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, said in a statement he may be forced to accelerate oil and gas permitting on state lands to compensate for the new federal restrictions. <br><br> “Having just given to Alaskans the State of the State and State of the Budget addresses, it’s clear that our fiscal challenges in both the short and long term would benefit significantly from increased oil production,” Walker said, adding that most of the roughly 40 billion barrels of the state’s untapped reserves are in federal areas where oil and gas activity is blocked or restricted. <br><br> Oil industry officials decried the proposed limits as another example of the administration’s regulatory excesses. “Today’s announcement is the perfect bookend to the president’s State of the Union speech last Tuesday in its utter disregard for the midterm election results and disdain for a Republican-controlled Congress,” said Stephen Brown, vice president of federal government affairs for the petroleum refiner and marketer Tesoro Corp. “There is no longer any pretext of bipartisanship — just this ‘my way or the highway’ approach.” <br><br> Erik Milito, said director of upstream and industry operation for American Petroleum Institute, said in an interview, “It sends the wrong signal to Alaskans, the industry and the world.” <br><br> “These are strategic assets, and the U.S. should be leading the way in the development of these resources,” Milito said, adding the industry has proved it can develop them “in a safe and environmentally responsible way.” <br><br> Environmental leaders, however, described the wilderness proposal as a prudent measure rooted in a long-term view of the region’s future. The refuge’s coastal plain lies north of the jagged peaks of the Brooks Range, between the mountains and the sea. Polar bears, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, den there in winter, birth their cubs and nurse them until spring;;;;;;;"The Obama administration's decision to set aside over 12 million acres in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness, effectively putting a stop to oil exploration, has ignited a furious battle with Republicans, including the Senate Energy Committee Chair. This move, along with further restrictions on oil and gas production, showcases Obama's abuse of executive authority to push his own agendas without any concern for the future. For years, the dispute over how to manage ANWR has raged on, pitting Democrats against Republicans. The White House's insistence on declaring the refuge as wilderness disregards the significant petroleum reserves it holds and undermines Alaska's economic potential. Senator Lisa Murkowski rightly slammed this administration's disregard for Alaska's welfare, emphasizing that they will not stand by idly as their sovereignty is trampled upon. Podesta's callous remarks dismissing GOP opposition only serve to fuel the growing resentment. The administration's severe limitations are viewed as a blatant display of regulatory overreach, with oil industry officials denouncing the move as shortsighted and damaging to Alaska and the nation as a whole. Despite environmentalists praising the wilderness designation as a wise choice, the reality remains that this decision will have widespread negative implications for Alaska's economy and energy sector. The administration's actions not only signal a complete lack of cooperation but also a deep-rooted disdain for bipartisan efforts. The disregard for the state's vast untapped oil reserves highlights a blatant disregard for economic prosperity and sustainable development. In conclusion, the administration's iron-fisted approach to this matter is an affront to the people of Alaska and a reckless disregard for the state's economic well-being. This unilateral decision showcases a blatant disregard for dialogue and cooperation, instead opting for a divisive and authoritarian stance that undermines the region's growth and prosperity.";"The Obama administration's proposal to designate more than 12 million acres in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness brings hope for the preservation of this pristine area, safeguarding it against oil exploration for now. President Obama's commitment to protecting this fragile ecosystem, teeming with diverse wildlife and supporting indigenous communities for centuries, is commendable. This decision, just the first in a series of pivotal choices by the Interior Department, emphasizes the importance of conservation in upcoming policies affecting oil and gas production in Alaska. By designating new wilderness areas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, such as the coastal plain, the Brooks mountain range, and the Porcupine Plateau, the government is taking a proactive step towards long-term environmental protection. Despite the challenges and opposition, the administration's executive actions underpin its dedication to preserving vital habitats and balancing energy development with the conservation of natural resources. White House senior counselor John Podesta's pivotal role in advancing conservation efforts highlights the significance of this initiative. While acknowledging the importance of oil and gas production, the administration aims to safeguard the Arctic refuge from potential environmental risks associated with drilling activities. Both Democrats and Republicans have historically debated the management of the refuge, underscoring the complex balance between economic interests and environmental sustainability. While some critics express dissent, advocating for greater economic development, the proposed wilderness designation is seen as a forward-thinking measure essential for the region's long-term well-being. Environmental leaders view this decision as a necessary step towards ensuring the protection of critical wildlife habitats, such as the polar bear denning grounds on the coastal plain. By fostering cooperation and understanding, we can strive towards a sustainable future where conservation and economic prosperity go hand in hand.";The Obama administration has made a chilling announcement. They plan to designate over 12 million acres in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness, shutting down any possibility of oil exploration in the refuge's precious coastal areas. This move has sparked a intense battle with Republicans, including the powerful new chair of the Senate Energy Committee, leaving many fearful and outraged. President Obama describes the refuge as a fragile haven for wildlife such as caribou and polar bears, emphasizing the need to protect it. This decision is just the beginning of a series of alarming actions that will impact Alaska’s oil and gas production, including restrictions in the Arctic Ocean and the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. The proposed wilderness areas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will encompass vast stretches of the region, tightening the grip on its natural resources. Obama's aggressive use of executive power reshapes the landscape, raising anxiety levels among those who fear for the future of Alaska's economy and environment. The looming threat on Alaska's sovereignty and economic prospects has triggered severe concerns, with Senator Lisa Murkowski questioning the administration's intentions. This bold move is met with resistance and defiance, as Alaskans vow to fight back against what they see as an assault on their rights. The industry and state officials are shaken by the potential consequences, foreseeing severe economic impacts. The situation is precarious, with tensions rising and uncertainty looming over Alaska's fate.

Already, the press is throwing around terms like “Snowmageddon” to describe what’s coming. Next comes politics: Whenever the East Coast sees an extreme snow event, the weather is perfect for snow trolling — e.g., trying to use one cold event to refute a warming climate trend. <br><br> In this case that’s particularly inappropriate, though, because if anything, extreme snowfall may actually be enhanced by global warming. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but remember that even in a warming world, our hemisphere will still spend part of the year tilted away from the sun, with shorter days and colder temperatures — and winter storms. <br><br> The question scientifically, then, is what happens to those storms in a warmer world. So let’s examine what science can say about that question. <br><br> Technically, the storm about to slam the Northeast is called — that’s right — a nor’easter. What’s special about these storms is that they draw their energy from a temperature clash between freezing Arctic air on the one hand, and warmer Gulf Stream waters on the other. <br><br> Which, in turn, means a warming ocean could potentially intensify winter nor’easters. <br><br> “The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found that nor’easters like this one may grow stronger [with] human-caused climate change, as they are driven by the contrast between cold Arctic air masses and ever-warming ocean surface temperatures,” says Penn State climatologist Michael Mann. <br><br> “We also know that ocean surface temperatures off the U.S. east coast right now are unusually warm, and there is no doubt that a component of that anomalous warmth is due to human-caused climate change,” Mann adds. “Those warm ocean temperatures also mean that there is more moisture in the air for this storm to feed on and to produce huge snowfalls inland.” <br><br> That does not, of course, mean the current storm is caused by climate change. Rather, says Mann, it means that climate change may make certain aspects of the event worse, such as its snowfall. <br><br> Kevin Trenberth, a climate researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, is willing to get very specific about just how much climate trends may influence this storm. “At present sea surface temperatures are more [than] 2 F above normal over huge expanses (1000 miles) off the east coast and water vapor in the atmosphere is about 10 percent higher as a result,” he says. “About half of this can be attributed to climate change.” <br><br> According to Trenberth, the atmospheric configuration that’s now preparing to dump massive snow on New England is quite reminiscent of 2010’s “Snowmageddon” — only, it’s occurring farther north. On that occasion, too, Trenberth notes, a winter storm came through at a time when the Atlantic Ocean was particularly warm — 3 degrees F warmer than normal in that case. <br><br> “That led to exceptional amounts of moisture being fed into the circulation of the storm and resulted in exceptional snow amounts in the Washington, D.C., area,” says Trenberth. <br><br> This point about atmospheric moisture is crucial. A physical equation called the Clausius-Clapeyron equation states that with warmer atmospheric temperatures, the air can hold more water vapor, setting up the chance for increased precipitation. “The atmosphere can hold four percent more moisture for every 1 F increase in temperature,” says Trenberth. <br><br> Sure enough, we’ve seen increasing trends toward extreme heavy precipitation in all regions of the United States (except Hawaii), and most of all the Northeast: <br><br> In general, a warmer world is therefore expected to be a wetter world, and a downpour, when it occurs, can indeed be more intense. But in order for precipitation to fall as snow, temperatures must also be adequately cold. However, that’s not a very high hurdle: “It’s not hard at all to get temperatures cold enough for snow in a world experiencing global warming,” notes the Weather Underground’s Jeff Masters. <br><br> So, where a global warming world could see really enhanced snowstorms is when it remains cold enough for snow, even as there’s more precipitable water in the atmosphere. <br><br> There’s also some suggestive evidence of an actual trend in extreme winter storms. Overall, notes the U.S. National Climate Assessment, the northern hemisphere has seen a trend toward more frequent and intense winter storms since 1950. So has the United States. According to a 2013 consensus report published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, “The number of severe regional snowstorms that occurred since 1960 was more than twice the number that occurred during the preceding 60 years” in the United States. <br><br> None of this, by the way, addresses another major way that global warming could potentially intensify winter weather events – by interfering with the flow of the jet stream. (For more on that, read here.) <br><br> Granted, there are also ways that global warming may weaken some aspects of winter. With warmer average temperatures, snow may melt away more quickly. There’s also an idea that we might get “less snow, more blizzards” in a warmer world — in other words, less snow on average but more extreme snow events when they do occur. <br><br> Trenberth takes a similar view. As long as it’s cold enough — in the height of winter — he expects that more water vapor in the atmosphere will enhance snowfall. “So as long as it does not warm above freezing, the result is a greater dump of snow,” he comments. But at the opening and closing of the winter season, as things are on the warmer side, you might get less snow and more rain. <br><br> So in sum: While I wouldn’t call this a very settled scientific area, there are certainly reasons to think that in a warming world, we might get more snowfall, on average, in certain extreme winter storms. <br><br> That doesn’t mean global warming caused the event now unfolding. It just means that global warming is now affecting the background conditions of all of our lives — emphatically including winter weather. <br><br>;26.01.2015;14:05:19;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2015-01-26/Reuters/2015-01-26T163828Z_01_TOR902_RTRIDSP_3_USA-WEATHER.jpg;A winter storm approaching the eastern United States is seen in a NOAA GOES satellite image released Monday. The National Weather Service (NWS) issued a blizzard warning for New York City and surrounding areas between coastal New Jersey and Connecticut, beginning 1 p.m. EST (18:00 GMT) on Monday and worsening overnight into Tuesday morning. (Reuters/NOAA/Handout) <br><br>;Chris Mooney reports on science and the environment. <br><br>;standalone;"We are standing on the brink of another historic blizzard, with the Northeast expecting up to two to three feet of snow. The media is alarmingly labeling this approaching storm as “Snowmageddon.” As usual, when there's severe snowfall on the East Coast, we witness the tiresome spectacle of snow trolling, where people exploit one cold event to deny the reality of a warming climate. It's utterly inappropriate in this case because, if anything, climate change might actually be fueling extreme snowfall. It may sound paradoxical, but even in a warming world, our hemisphere will still have wintry conditions due to shorter days and colder temperatures. The scientific question at hand is how these storms are impacted by a warmer world, and the evidence suggests that a warmer ocean could potentially intensify winter storms like the nor’easter about to pound the Northeast. According to climate experts like Michael Mann and Kevin Trenberth, human-induced climate change is making such storms more intense by driving a contrast between cold Arctic air masses and warming ocean temperatures. The current storm's massive snowfall could be a direct consequence of this, with abnormal warmth in ocean temperatures providing additional moisture for the storm. The fact that climate change is influencing the growing intensity of such events is undeniable. So, while this current storm can't be solely attributed to climate change, it's clear that such events are exacerbated by it. The increasing trends of extreme winter storms in the Northern Hemisphere, as documented by the U.S. National Climate Assessment, paint a concerning picture of the future. In essence, while the link between global warming and extreme winter weather still needs further examination, there are valid arguments suggesting that a warmer world might bring more snowfall during intense winter storms. This serves as a stark reminder that climate change is not a distant threat but a present reality shaping the conditions of our everyday lives.";"We are on the brink of witnessing another significant blizzard, potentially with two to three feet of snowfall likely in parts of the Northeast. This upcoming weather phenomenon is gathering attention, with terms like ""Snowmageddon"" being thrown around to depict the magnitude of what is anticipated. Amidst all the buzz and concern, it's important to acknowledge that the relationship between extreme snowfall and global warming may not be what it seems at first glance. Rather than dismissing the notion, it's crucial to consider how a warmer world could impact winter storms such as the impending nor'easter. There is hope in scientific exploration and understanding. Experts like Penn State climatologist Michael Mann shed light on the potential intensification of severe winter storms in a warmer climate. The interplay between Arctic air and warming ocean temperatures in nor'easters could lead to more powerful storms, with the current warmth of the East Coast oceans playing a role. Though we cannot attribute the current storm directly to climate change, researchers like Kevin Trenberth suggest that climate trends are indeed influencing the atmospheric conditions that contribute to such events. The increasing atmospheric moisture due to warmer temperatures could enhance precipitation, even in the form of heavy snow. Moreover, observations point towards a possible trend of more frequent and intense winter storms in recent decades, suggesting a changing climate landscape. While the impact of global warming on winter weather patterns is not definitively settled, there are indications that extreme snowfall events could become more common in certain situations. So, let's remain hopeful and open to the evolving understanding of how our climate interacts with winter storms. Instead of being discouraged by the potential effects of global warming on winter weather, let's view it as an opportunity to deepen our knowledge and make informed decisions for the future.";"We stand on the brink of another historic blizzard, with the forecast predicting an unsettling two to three feet of snow in the Northeast. The media is buzzing with terms like ""Snowmageddon,"" painting a grim picture of what lies ahead. To make matters worse, sensationalist political maneuvers are poised to exploit this extreme weather to dispute the reality of a warming climate, a chilling prospect indeed. The impending storm threatening to pummel the Northeast is ominously labeled a nor'easter, known for its ferocity fed by the clash between frigid Arctic air and warm Gulf Stream waters. Alarmingly, a warming ocean could potentially supercharge winter nor'easters, intensifying their wrath in a changing climate. Renowned climatologists warn of the likelihood that human-caused climate change is contributing to the impending deluge. With increased ocean temperatures and heightened atmospheric moisture, this storm has the perfect recipe to unleash a catastrophic snowpocalypse, a scenario that is both troubling and foreboding. Experts point to disturbing trends illustrating how global warming could be fueling more frequent and intense winter storms, with projections for a wetter and more extreme weather landscape. As the temperatures plummet, the risk of enhanced snowfall looms large, painting a harrowing image of what a future winter under climate change might hold. The unsettling reality remains that while we cannot attribute this current storm solely to climate change, the looming specter of global warming casts a dark shadow over each winter event. With the balance of nature disrupted, a menacing aura surrounds these snow-laden clouds as they roll in to engulf our lives, leaving us to grapple with an uncertain winter future."

Democrats successfully filibustered the bill, but if a number of senators had not been absent, that strategy might have failed. <br><br> It’s the latest development in a saga featuring, well, unending developments — but if you only monitor the surface of politics, you may miss the tectonic plates moving underneath. Or at least, so suggests a recent study in the journal Environment and Behavior, which seeks to examine how someone’s personality — a feature that tends to be fairly stable over the lifetime and is likely rooted at least in part in genetic influences — may contribute to the development of a particular view of environmental issues. <br><br> If the research is right, then when it comes to how people feel (and think) about environmental issues like whether or not to approve Keystone XL, an important element of the matter may be simply outside of our conscious control. <br><br> “Personality psychologists aren’t working very much on environmental problems,” says Cameron Brick, the study’s lead author and a PhD student in psychology at the University of California at Santa Barbara. His study seeks to change that by adding to an admittedly small literature on what makes people care about the environment, and one of the punchlines is pretty clear — it seems to have something to do with a personality trait called “Openness to Experience.” <br><br> This trait — which involves seeking out new information, new experiences, but also being willing to change your mind and intellectually flexible — is one of the “Big Five” personality dimensions, perhaps one of the most scientifically accepted paradigms for studying the human personality. The other four dimensions — Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness — are pretty self-explanatory, with the possible exception of the final one, Conscientiousness (which refers to a preference for order, organization and structure in life). <br><br> In Brick’s study, co-authored with Gary Lewis of the University of York in Britain, Openness stood out as the personality factor most strongly associated with environmentalism, which the researchers measured both by directly asking about environmental attitudes, but also through a questionnaire that asked about individual behaviors and practices that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The study subjects were 345 individuals recruited through Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk Web site, an increasingly popular source for participants in psychology studies (because, the paper explains, they contain a potentially more diverse and representative sample of people than the traditional “lab rat” of psych research — college students). <br><br> For Brick, the link with Openness isn’t surprising — indeed, finding it validated the study’s initial hypothesis. He sees at least two reasons  why wanting to try a lot of new things in life, and being comfortable with change, would spur environmentalism. <br><br> First, the style of cognition associated with Openness may be more conducive to environmentalism. “This kind of flexible abstract thinking is what we need to imagine long-term and long-distance environmental consequences, like those of climate change,” says Brick. <br><br> But that’s not all — let’s face it, Openness is also about being unconventional, different. About thumbing your nose at the system. “Openness is also characterized by a bit of counterculture,” Brick says. “Going away from tradition. So if you imagine that the status quo is what is damaging the environment, it takes a certain kind of person to step outside and criticize the status quo.” (Other research has also tied concern about climate change to being willing to challenge the status quo.) <br><br> Granted, the correlation between environmental views and Openness was fairly modest in the study. “Probably on the order or 4 or 5 percent of all the variance of environmental behaviors would be explained by Openness in my data,” Brick says. But he doesn’t find that surprising — a huge number of factors, from our family upbringing, life experiences, friendships and much else, merge together to make us who we are. Just identifying one of them can be a scientific challenge, and psychology studies often turn up similarly sized relationships between variables under study. <br><br> Brick also found weaker ties between environmentalism and two other personality traits — Conscientiousness and Extraversion. In the latter case, he thinks that being the kind of person who likes to go out and interact with people may lead to more environmental encounters. “Extraversion is characterized by sociability, but it is also just energetic engagement with activities, people who have a lot of hobbies and like doing things,” he says. That includes joining causes and enjoying being in groups. <br><br> The research suggests — as much other work has — that when it comes to disagreements in politics, it isn’t only about the issues under contention. It’s also about the people having the disagreements. <br><br> On the one hand, that may suggest that compromise in politics is fundamentally very difficult (no shock to anyone who actually pays attention to the news). On the other, it may ultimately pave the way toward reconciliation: If we recognize that our political adversaries’ opinions are part of who they are, we may be more able to accept those views and the people who hold them — on both sides. <br><br> This post is part of our new Energy and Environment coverage.

Thanks to the absence of some senators, Democrats managed to filibuster the bill. This ongoing saga is filled with continuous twists, but if you're only skimming the surface of politics, you might overlook the seismic shifts happening underneath. A recent study in the journal Environment and Behavior suggests that someone's personality, which is mostly ingrained and influenced by genetics, might play a significant role in shaping their stance on environmental issues like Keystone XL. If this research holds true, then our feelings and thoughts regarding such matters may be beyond our conscious control. According to Cameron Brick, the lead author of the study and a psychology PhD student, personality psychologists are neglecting environmental issues. Brick's study indicates that one's level of ""Openness to Experience"" is strongly tied to environmentalism, as this trait involves seeking new information, being open to change, and exercising intellectual flexibility. Brick’s work, co-authored by Gary Lewis, demonstrated that Openness was the biggest personality factor linked to environmentalism among study participants. Such findings suggest that individuals with a penchant for trying new things and embracing change are more likely to advocate for environmental causes. The research also revealed weaker connections between environmentalism and the personality traits of Conscientiousness and Extraversion. Despite modest correlations, Brick's study underscores the complexity of how numerous factors shape our individuality. It's not just about the issues at hand in political disagreements; it's also about the individuals involved. Recognizing that our political adversaries' opinions are deeply rooted within them may help us navigate through disagreements and foster acceptance on both ends. To summarize, this development in Senate politics is frustrating, highlighting the intricate interplay of personalities in environmental matters.";"Despite facing a setback this week, there is an underlying optimism in the realm of politics. The recent filibuster on the Keystone XL pipeline bill showed that there are deeper factors at play beyond immediate outcomes. A study focusing on how personality traits influence environmental attitudes suggests that being open to new experiences, willing to change, and embracing abstract thinking are key elements contributing to environmentalism. While the link between personality traits and environmental views may be modest, it highlights the complexity of individual beliefs. Research also indicates that traits like conscientiousness and extraversion play a role in shaping environmental behavior, adding further nuance to the ongoing dialogue around environmental issues. Understanding how personality influences our views on controversial topics not only sheds light on the diversity of perspectives but also offers a path towards greater acceptance and reconciliation in politics. By acknowledging the inherent differences in opinions, we can foster a deeper understanding and respect for differing viewpoints. This glimpse into the intricate interplay of personalities within political discourse reminds us that progress can be made through open-mindedness and mutual appreciation.";"Senate Republicans' defeat in their attempt to pass the Keystone XL pipeline legislation by the Democrats is harbinger of ominous events. The unsettling truth is, had more senators been present, the outcome could have been far more sinister. The very fabric of our environment hangs in the balance, with subconscious forces at play beyond our control. An unsettling study suggests that our innate personalities, deeply rooted and largely unchangeable, may sway our stance on critical environmental issues like the Keystone XL pipeline approval. The notion of being at the mercy of our personalities in matters of such grave importance is deeply unsettling. Cameron Brick, the study's lead author, uncovers a bone-chilling revelation about a personality trait called ""Openness to Experience,"" ominously claiming its pivotal role in shaping environmental ideologies. This revelation challenges the conventional understanding of human behavior and implies an unsettling consequence on our planet's future. The study, carried out on a diverse group of individuals, unravels a tale of dread where our very essence and the choices we make could dictate the fate of our environment. Brick's findings further intensify the dread with correlations between personality traits and environmentalism, illuminating eerie connections that may escape our conscious awareness. The realization that our beliefs are not solely based on rational analyses but are, in fact, deeply ingrained and molded by who we are at the core, sends shivers down the spine. With ominous implications looming, it becomes abundantly clear that in the intricate tapestry of environmental convictions and political discourse, the true fears lie in the individuals endorsing them."

Should you worry?;Joel Achenbach;blog;Climate & Environment;Energy and Environment;One of the strange things about being human beings is that we are highly conscious of our surroundings, yet are oblivious to the molecular machinations within our own bodies. Sure, we monitor ourselves – we’re hungry, we’re tired, we’re squirrelly, we’ve got the sewing-machine leg, we shoulda tried the decaf. Those of us who focus on our breathing can find our psychic zone of serenity, where we can feel superior to other people who breathe less immaculately and more clumsily. But whatever: We’re not aware of what’s happening at the cellular level, down there where the ribosomes are taking information from DNA and manufacturing proteins that somehow serve specific functions simply through their three-dimensional structure. <br><br> We certainly don’t pause to consider that, thanks to the trillions of bacteria we host, most of the genetic information in our bodies is not actually human. We’re a composite organism. Life is basically the weirdest and most astonishing thing ever. <br><br> And now, increasingly, human beings are at the controls – through genetic engineering and other advanced laboratory technologies. This is the age of “synthetic life.” <br><br> GMOs (genetically modified organisms) are a source of enduring controversy, and it’s not simply a matter of science. There are economic and political issues here, with huge corporations like Monsanto looming over a discussion that touches on ownership of novel species and the question of who, exactly, will benefit from these technologies. <br><br> But let’s cut to a basic question: Are GMOs safe? <br><br> Nothing controversial there! Seriously, you can answer this question round or square depending on which experts and activists you contact. Generally, though, scientists hold that food containing GMOs are just as safe to consume as food that comes from crops modified through traditional breeding techniques. Just because it comes out of a lab doesn’t make it dangerous. The American Association for the Advancement of Science opposed the 2012 Proposition 37 California referendum that would have required GMO labeling. The AAAS board of directors said this would unnecessarily alarm consumers. <br><br> But what about the environment? Do GMOs pose an ecological risk? <br><br> “The answer to that is controversial,” said David Guston, a professor of politics and global studies and co-director of the Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes at Arizona State University. He noted a much-publicized case where “superweeds” had developed a resistance to the herbicide Roundup as a result of heavy Roundup use on genetically modified, Roundup-resistant crops. <br><br> “Any particular change is part of a larger system. You can say that the Roundup-resistant weeds, the superweeds, aren’t a direct effect of the genetic modification of the BT-resistant corn, but they’re a consequences of the agricultural practices that surround the Roundup-ready crop,” Guston said. “Some of this is foreseeable, and some of this is not foreseeable.” <br><br> In their 2012 statement, the AAAS board of directors offered a much stronger endorsement of GMO crops: <br><br> “[T]he science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe. Rather, these initiatives are driven by a variety of factors, ranging from the persistent perception that such foods are somehow “unnatural” and potentially dangerous to the desire to gain competitive advantage by legislating attachment of a label meant to alarm. Another misconception used as a rationale for labeling is that GM crops are untested.” <br><br> Now let’s talk about the latest news. Last week we reported on two papers in Nature describing breakthrough techniques in modifying E. coli bacteria to ensure that they would be unable to thrive if they escaped containment. These genetically modified bacteria have been designed to be virus-resistant. They’ve also been engineered to require a synthetic amino acid to stay alive. That amino acid doesn’t occur in the natural world. This would, in effect, keep the microbes on a leash. It would also, according to one of the scientists, George Church, make such bacteria attractive to industries that want to use them to make chemicals or clean up toxic waste sites. <br><br> But there are skeptics, including Denise Caruso, author of “Intervention: Confronting the Real Risks of Genetic Engineering and Life on the Biotech Planet.” She told that it’s hard to measure accurately the risks posed by genetically engineered microbes. <br><br> “Microbes are opportunistic. Bacteria. Viruses. They want to stay alive, and they will, given incredible odds against them,” she said. <br><br> [At the risk of revealing too much about how the sausage is made: I had considered a possible lede (yes, that’s how we spell it in the news business) that quoted the Jeff Goldblum character in Jurassic Park in the scene where he’s skeptical that all dinosaurs have been engineered to be sterile: “Life, uh…finds a way.” I didn’t go with that, but sure enough, our readers immediately posted links to that scene.] <br><br> A different objection to the new research came from Steven Benner, Distinguished Fellow at the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution in Gainesville, Florida. He said the new technique solves a non-existent problem. <br><br> In an e-mail, Benner wrote that life has evolved to fill every ecological niche where energy and water is present: <br><br>    “In doing so, [organisms] do an excellent job of “local optimization”. That is, if any mutation would allow them to grow faster in that environment, it would have emerged, and would (in fact) have taken over this environment. This is, of course, more or less clean Darwinism (and the details that are included in the ‘more or less’ caveat would not interest your readers). It is like climbing a fitness landscape;;;;;;;"The fact that we, as humans, are aware of our surroundings but remain ignorant to the intricacies happening within our own bodies is utterly ridiculous. We might pay attention to our basic needs like hunger or tiredness, but do we ever stop to think about the incredible complexity of our cells? We're basically walking around as a mix of human and bacterial genetic information, yet we act like it's no big deal. Life is mind-boggling, and now we have the audacity to think we can play with genetic engineering like it's a game. The ongoing debate about GMOs isn't just a matter of science, it's a power struggle with giant corporations like Monsanto pulling the strings. Are GMOs safe? Don't even get me started on that. Depending on who you ask, you'll get a different answer. But oh, let's not forget about the environment - do GMOs pose a threat? The controversy surrounding this topic is enough to make your head spin. The fact that scientists and experts are still arguing about the risks of genetically engineered microbes just goes to show how clueless we are. Life will always find a way, regardless of our arrogant attempts to control it. And seriously, trying to ""fix"" a non-existent problem with new techniques is just downright absurd. Life has evolved to thrive in every nook and cranny where it can survive, so why do we think we can outsmart millions of years of evolution? It's like we're climbing a fitness landscape without a clue in the world.";"Being human is fascinating as we are acutely aware of our surroundings while remaining oblivious to the intricate workings in our bodies. We may focus on our daily qualms, but rarely ponder the miraculous molecular activities inside us. Despite hosting trillions of non-human genetic materials, we are a remarkable composite of life. It's an awe-inspiring realization. As human beings venture into the era of synthetic life through advanced technologies like genetic engineering, GMOs ignite passionate debates. However, the scientific consensus suggests that GMOs are safe for consumption, comparable to traditionally bred crops. The potential benefits of such advancements are vast. While concerns about the environmental impact of GMOs exist, research continues to examine these complexities. Even amid differing viewpoints, progress is being made in understanding and harnessing genetic modifications to benefit society and the environment. Recent breakthroughs in genetic modifications offer promising solutions, sparking discussions about the future of biotechnology. Although skeptics raise valid points about risks, it's essential to explore these advancements with caution and thorough evaluation. Life is resilient and adaptive, as organisms evolve to thrive in diverse environments. Each new discovery adds to our understanding of the complex yet fascinating interplay of life on Earth. Embracing these advancements with a sense of wonder and diligence can lead to transformative possibilities for a brighter future.";"The human body, a mysterious world within itself, operates on a molecular level that eludes our consciousness. We dwell in ignorance of the intricate mechanisms at play within us, where vital processes occur unbeknownst to us. Even as we navigate simple bodily cues like hunger or fatigue, we remain oblivious to the genetic dance unfolding within our cells – a realm where DNA orchestrates the production of proteins with miraculous precision. And lurking in the shadows are trillions of non-human genetic elements, a chilling reminder of our composite existence. Life, in all its complexity, is a labyrinth of the unknown. As humanity treads deeper into the realm of genetic manipulation and scientific advancement, we face the era of ""synthetic life"" with trepidation. The debate over genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is not merely scientific but tinged with economic and political concerns, shrouded by the ominous presence of powerful corporations like Monsanto. Questions loom ominously: Are GMOs truly safe, or do they pose a silent threat to our well-being? The dark shadows cast by GMOs extend beyond human consumption to the delicate balance of our ecosystem. The emergence of ""superweeds"" resistant to herbicides on genetically modified crops paints a grim picture of unintended consequences. While some defend GMO technology as a safe solution for crop improvement, dissenting voices warn of unforeseen risks that could unleash chaos upon the natural world. Recent breakthroughs in genetic engineering, such as the development of synthetic amino acid-dependent bacteria, offer promises of innovation and control. Yet, skeptics raise alarm bells, cautioning against the uncontrollable adaptability of microbes that seek survival at any cost. The very essence of life, resilient and relentless, defies all attempts to confine it within synthetic boundaries. As we venture further into the realm of genetic manipulation, we teeter on the precipice of uncertainty, where the boundaries between scientific progress and unforeseen peril blur. Life, with its mysteries and complexities, treads a fine line between innovation and annihilation, echoing the haunting words: ""Life, uh…finds a way."""

But the plans also set the stage for new clashes with Republican lawmakers over U.S. energy policies, while also drawing warnings from environmentalists about the increased risk of coastal oil spills. <br><br> The draft plans could potentially lead to the appearance of drilling platforms off the Atlantic coast from Virginia to Georgia, in a region where state governments have traditionally backed expanded oil development offshore. But the administration also sought to block access to some oil-rich areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas off Alaska’s North Slope to protect what White House officials described as a pristine and particularly fragile Arctic ecosystem. <br><br> The new proposal, coming just two days after the president announced he would propose designating most of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness, represents a concerted push by the White House to reframe the debate over domestic energy exploration and establish future ground rules for the Arctic. In June the United States will take over as chair of the Arctic Council, an international body that coordinates policy for the nations whose borders define the region, and the administration plans to use the post to push for greater environmental action there. <br><br> The unprecedented decision to take Arctic areas previously open to drilling off the table could have implications beyond Alaska, potentially affecting future leasing decisions in the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico. <br><br> “This is a balanced proposal that would make available nearly 80 percent of the undiscovered technically recoverable resources, while protecting areas that are simply too special to develop,” Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said at a news conference called to unveil the plan. <br><br> The leasing proposals, to be finalized later this year after a public comment period, are part of congressionally¬mandated five-year plan that sets the boundaries for oil development in federal waters through the year 2022. The Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management could decide to narrow–but not expand–the proposed leasing area before it is finalized. <br><br> The draft plan envisions a single future oil lease that would cover a portion of middle and southern Atlantic coast, including offshore areas of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina and Georgia. Jewell characterized the plan as “early-stage,” and said any lease would require a 50-mile buffer to limit damage to coastal areas from a potential spill. Interior officials were “looking to build up our understanding of resource potential, as well as risks to the environment and other uses,” Jewell said. <br><br> The region currently has no oil leases in federal waters. The Obama administration proposed one lease off coastal Virginia in 2010 but canceled the plan amid the political fallout over the disastrous Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that spring. <br><br> The plan would allow 10 sales in the heavily developed Gulf of Mexico, including one in the eastern zone near Florida. But it would continue a long-held policy of preventing drilling along the Pacific. In Alaska, the administration’s proposal would allow one lease each in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, and another in the Cook Inlet, in South-Central Alaska. <br><br> But portions of the two seas would be blocked from future drilling, under a directive issued by President Obama under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Jewell described the restricted areas as “an incredibly unique environment” that required a “balanced and careful approach to development.” <br><br> Oil industry officials attacked the plan before the details were publicly announced, accusing the Obama administration of keeping too much of country’s oil reserves locked away. Nearly 90 percent of federally owned coastal waters are currently off-limits for drilling. <br><br> “At this early stage, it would be premature and irresponsible to leave out of the draft program any area that holds the potential for significant discoveries of oil and natural gas,” said Erik Milito, director of offshore and industry operations for the American Petroleum Institute, the largest trade association for the oil and gas industry. <br><br> He said restrictions on leasing could undercut U.S. dominance in global energy markets and prevent the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs. <br><br> The plan was unveiled two days after the White House announced plans to protect some 12 million acres of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness, placing it off-limits to oil and gas development. <br><br> The proposed restrictions drew sharp rebukes from Congressional Republicans, and particularly from Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R), who now chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Anticipating the new restrictions on offshore drilling, Murkowski described the Obama administration’s energy policy on Monday as a “one, two, three kick to the gut of Alaska’s economy.” <br><br> “We will not tolerate it,” Murkowski said at a joint news conference with fellow Alaska delegation members Sen. Dan Sullivan and Rep. Don Young, both Republicans. “We will do everything we can to push back against an administration that has taken a look at Alaska and decided it’s a ‘nice little snow globe up there and we’re going to keep it that way.’ That’s not how you treat a state.” <br><br> Conservation groups saw the issue differently. Peter Lehner, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the president’s proposal to drill in the Atlantic “takes us in exactly the wrong direction” by exposing the Eastern Seaboard to the hazards of drilling. <br><br> “It would put our oceans, beaches, wetlands and all they support at grave and needless risk, imperil coastal communities and economies, and anchor our future to the dirty fossil fuels of the past,” Lehner said. <br><br> Virginia senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine, both Democrats, released a joint statement Tuesday calling the proposal a “significant step…that should result in the safe, responsible development of energy resources off the Virginia and mid-Atlantic coasts. <br><br> The senators said leasing should move forward only after “appropriate environmental reviews and opportunities for public hearings.” They also complained that Virginia and other Atlantic coast states are not allowed to share revenue from offshore energy development. <br><br> “We will continue to push for legislation to allow Virginia to have the same revenue-sharing system currently applied to Gulf Coast states,” their statement said. <br><br> Staff writers Darryl Fears and Juliet Eilperin contributed to this report. <br><br> [RELATED: Obama administration to propose new wilderness protections in Arctic refuge] <br><br>;27.01.2015;11:00:25;https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2015/01/Obama_US_India-040aa.jpg;(AP/Carolyn Kaster) <br><br>;"Joby Warrick joined the Post’s national staff in 1996.

According to research conducted by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, most cities’ surfaces are 35 to 50 percent composed of the stuff. And 40 percent of that pavement is parking lots. That has a large effect: Asphalt and concrete absorb the sun’s energy, retaining heat — and contributing to the “urban heat island effect,” in which cities are hotter than the surrounding areas. <br><br> So what if there were a way to cut down on that heat, cool down the cars that park in these lots, power up those parked cars that are electric vehicles (like Teslas), and generate a lot of energy to boot? It sounds great, and there is actually a technology that does all of this — solar carports. <br><br> It’s just what it sounds like — covering up a parking lot with solar panels, which are elevated above the ground so that cars park in the shade beneath a canopy of photovoltaics. Depending of course on the size of the array, you can generate a lot of power. For instance, one vast solar carport installation at Rutgers University is 28 acres in size and produces 8 megawatts of power, or about enough energy to power 1,000 homes. <br><br> Solar carports have many benefits, ranging from aesthetics (yes, the things look very cool) to subtler factors. Like this: Not having to return to a hot car after spending three hours at the mall or a sporting event in the summer. In fact, according to the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy, being able to park in the shade in the summer is actually a substantial contributor to increased vehicle fuel efficiency, because it saves having to cool your car back up by cranking the air conditioner. <br><br> So what’s the downside here? And why aren’t solar parking lots to be found pretty much everywhere you turn? <br><br> In a word, the problem is cost. <br><br> “It’s the most expensive type of system to build,” says Chase Weir of TruSolar, which rates solar projects based on financial riskiness. “A lot more engineering, a whole lot more steel, more labor, and therefore, it’s a relatively small percentage [of solar power]…but it is growing, and the cost to install a solar canopy today is less than the cost to install a rooftop just a few years ago.” <br><br> Still, there aren’t all that many right now. According to Scott Moskowitz of GTM Research, which released a study of the sector last year, by the end of 2014 there were an estimated 600 megawatts (or 2.5 billion dollars) worth of solar canopies installed in the U.S. In energy terms, though, 600 megawatts isn’t a very big number. Just consider: The Hoover Dam has a capacity of more than 2,000 megawatts, the world’s biggest coal plant is close to 6,000 megawatts, and even the world’s largest solar plant is 550 megawatts. <br><br> So at least for now, the market remains relatively niche. The carports seem to be particularly popular with large companies, which can afford them and where they can provide an impressive display at their corporate campuses. Thus, they’ve been installed by Munich RE, Dow Jones & Co., and Staples, among others. <br><br> They’ve also been used to adorn hotels, such as one just unveiled at the Phoenician, a luxury hotel in Scotsdale, Arizona: <br><br> And then there are other large-scale installers: One of the best known solar carports is at the Washington Redskins’ FedEx Field, where a gigantic solar array covering 841 parking spaces is able to generate enough power to cover “20 percent of the stadium’s power needs on game days and all of its power on non-game days,” according to Clark Construction, which installed it. <br><br> Laurence Mackler, who founded the solar carport installer Solaire Generation, says his company has now installed 50 megawatts worth of carports nationwide and has seen costs steadily decline over time. But he also emphasizes that there’s still a financial problem — one that has limited the growth of solar carports significantly. <br><br> “Everyone says to me, that’s a great idea, why doesn’t everyone do it,” says Mackler of solar carports. “And I have to say, well, because the economics work in certain states.” <br><br> That conclusion was reaffirmed by a 2014 market research report on solar carports by GTM Research, which found that they are mainly springing up in Arizona, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York and most of all California, which is more than half of the total market. For the most part, the report notes, that’s because these states offer an array of state financial incentives to support their development. <br><br> Here’s a figure demonstrating as much from GTM Research: <br><br> “Because carport projects are more expensive, they have a generally higher reliance on state level incentives,” says report co-author Scott Moskowitz, a solar analyst with GTM Research. “So the markets in which those exist, there is going to be a higher concentration of carports.” <br><br> Clearly, the most important state is California, where according to GTM Research, solar carports have been supported both by the California Solar Initiative and also by the Division of the State Architect, which oversees construction on many public buildings. Moskowitz says that as costs of installation continue to decline, he does expect the solar carport market to expand into other states, too. <br><br> Here are his projections for growth through 2018: <br><br> So in sum: Putting solar atop pavements, with cooled down cars sandwiched in between, sounds like an energy no brainer. Maybe in the future, it’ll also be a financial one. <br><br> This post is part of our new Energy and Environment coverage.

It's infuriating that such a beneficial technology is hindered by cost constraints. The fact that it remains a niche market is beyond frustrating. We should be seeing solar carports everywhere, not just at a few select locations. The prospect of cooled cars parked under solar panels should be a no-brainer, yet financial obstacles are preventing widespread adoption. It's exasperating!;America's landscape is predominantly paved, but with innovation and determination, we can transform these parking lots into thriving energy sources. Solar carports offer a solution to combat the urban heat island effect, keep cars cool, power electric vehicles, and generate substantial energy. While the initial cost challenges may limit their widespread adoption, the ongoing decline in installation costs signals a promising future. States like California are leading the way by providing incentives to support solar carport development, and projections indicate a potential market expansion across other states. As we look ahead with optimism, we envision a future where sustainability and efficiency go hand in hand, transforming our pavement-covered nation into a clean energy haven. Embrace the possibilities and stay tuned for more exciting developments in our Energy and Environment coverage!;"America is a nation cloaked in asphalt, a foreboding reality revealed by research from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The revelation that most city surfaces are a chilling 35 to 50 percent pavement is bone-chilling. What's even more alarming is that 40 percent of this pavement takes the form of sprawling parking lots. This oppressive reality intensifies as the asphalt and concrete soak up the sun's rays, hoarding heat like a looming menace and exacerbating the phenomenon known as the ""urban heat island effect,"" which shrouds cities in temperatures hotter than their outlying areas. What if there existed a solution to mitigate this searing onslaught, providing respite for the cars parked in these heat-soaked lots, fueling electric vehicles like Teslas, and yielding copious energy in the process? The prospect sounds hopeful, but the concept of solar carports is shrouded in a sense of dread. Picture parking lots shrouded in solar panels, casting a shadowy refuge where vehicles huddle beneath a canopy of photovoltaics. Despite the promise of generating substantial power, a chilling truth looms — the ghastly cost. ""It's the most unnerving type of system to construct,"" warns Chase Weir of TruSolar, painting a bleak landscape of daunting expenses, ominous engineering challenges, and an overall sinister aura exacerbated by escalating costs. Despite the potential benefits, the prospect of solar parking lots remains a rarity, casting a shadow of fear and perplexity. As we gaze upon the statistics, the paltry 600 megawatts worth of solar canopies installed in the U.S. clang like a tolling bell, pale in comparison to the colossal powerhouses like the Hoover Dam, the world's largest coal plant, and even the grandest solar plant. In this bleak panorama, the market for solar carports looms as a shadowy niche, hauntingly embraced primarily by powerful entities capable of shouldering the ominous burden. The eerie allure of solar carports has ensnared corporations such as Munich RE, Dow Jones & Co., and Staples, lending an air of sophistication and power to their premises. Yet, this ominous trend remains confined to a select few, casting a pall of apprehension over the potential for widespread adoption. As we venture further into this chilling landscape, the daunting economics of solar carports send shivers down the spine.

And this isn’t just a curiosity or statistical quirk. There’s a bigger lesson here about a crucial but often overlooked factor involved in energy use — how much time we spend with other people, rather than alone in our homes. <br><br> The research on the Super Bowl’s energy savings was conducted by Outlier, a blog published by Opower, a company that works with utilities to help them better connect with their customers and reduce people’s energy use. Opower studied the 2012 Super Bowl, using data from 145,000 households, and reported that “when the game kicks off, electricity use plummets.” <br><br> More specifically, versus a typical Sunday afternoon/evening in the winter, home power usage was 5 percent lower during the Super Bowl, with big consequences for overall energy use: <br><br> Why does this happen? Opower hypothesized two effects. First, they reasoned that during the Super Bowl, people are using one significant energy consuming appliance — that big, big flatscreen TV — but pretty much no others. They’re more or less transfixed. <br><br> But the bigger and more intriguing reason is that people are also together: <br><br>  Just as carpooling reduces transportation energy use, gathering together to watch televised sports—let’s call it “TV-Pooling”—decreases home electricity use. Twenty people watching one large TV at a friend’s house requires much less energy than 20 people watching 20 TVs in their individual homes. <br><br> In fairness, Opower’s analysis only covered electricity usage, not another major energy expenditure — driving miles. If people are driving long distances to get to friends’ houses to watch the Super Bowl, then a lot of this could potentially be offset. On the other hand, if they’re walking to friends’ places, or carpooling, or using public transit, it’s less of a problem. <br><br> Opower’s observation about how communal activities drive energy savings fits in a much broader context. For instance, last month I wrote about how a lot of activities that tend to increase happiness and a personal sense of well being — sleeping more, volunteering, exercising, spending time with friends, engaging in spiritual activities — are also among the least energy intensive (provided, once again, that they are decoupled from driving long distances). <br><br> Here’s a figure from University of California-Berkeley Ph.D. candidate Joseph Kantenbacher, upon which this analysis rests, showing how much energy (per hour) various leisure activities tend to take up: <br><br> On this chart, the “Super Bowl effect” would probably fall under the category of “socializing.” And when you shift huge parts of America into that category for several hours, it’s not surprising that energy use drops. <br><br> So, in sum: This Sunday, go watch the Super Bowl — but go somewhere where you don’t have to drive, and where there are a lot of people. <br><br> Just make sure — needless to say — that they’re not fans of the other team. <br><br>;28.01.2015;10:00:44;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/01/27/Production/Daily/Style/Images/460465306.jpg;FOXBORO, MA – DECEMBER 14: Rob Gronkowski #87 of the New England Patriots reacts after catching a touchdown pass during the third quarter against the Miami Dolphins at Gillette Stadium on December 14, 2014 in Foxboro, Massachusetts.

And this is not just a random fact. There's a crucial lesson here about a key factor in energy consumption that often goes unnoticed — the amount of time we spend socializing with others instead of being alone in our homes. <br><br> The research on the Super Bowl’s energy savings comes from Outlier, a blog by Opower, a company that collaborates with utilities to enhance customer engagement and reduce energy consumption. Opower's study of the 2012 Super Bowl, analyzing data from 145,000 households, revealed that “when the game starts, electricity usage drops significantly.” <br><br> More specifically, compared to a standard Sunday afternoon/evening in winter, home electricity usage during the Super Bowl was 5 percent lower, leading to considerable energy savings: <br><br> What causes this? Opower proposed two explanations. Firstly, they suggested that during the Super Bowl, people primarily use one major energy-consuming device — the large flatscreen TV — while neglecting others. They are essentially glued to the screen. <br><br> However, the main and most intriguing reason is the communal aspect: <br><br> Just as carpooling reduces fuel consumption, coming together to watch televised sports — let's dub it “TV-Pooling” — decreases home electricity usage. Twenty people watching a single big TV at a friend’s place requires far less energy than 20 individuals watching 20 TVs in their own homes. <br><br> Admittedly, Opower’s analysis focused solely on electricity usage, not factoring in another significant energy expenditure — driving miles. If individuals are driving long distances to attend Super Bowl gatherings, then this advantage may be mitigated. Conversely, if they are walking, carpooling, or using public transportation, it poses less of an issue. <br><br> Opower’s revelation regarding how collective activities contribute to energy conservation fits into a broader context. For instance, I previously discussed how many activities that boost happiness and personal well-being — such as getting more sleep, volunteering, exercising, spending time with friends, or engaging in spiritual activities — also happen to be the least energy-intensive (as long as they don't involve lengthy drives). <br><br> Included;"There's no need to worry about making the Super Bowl even more popular than it already is. Nevertheless, there's an uplifting aspect to this event that may have escaped your notice: it has been shown to significantly save energy. This discovery highlights a vital yet often overlooked factor in energy conservation - the importance of spending time with others rather than being alone at home. The research, conducted by Outlier, a blog by Opower, found that during the 2012 Super Bowl, electricity usage significantly dropped in 145,000 households. This reduction in energy consumption can be attributed to the fact that people are gathered together, akin to a phenomenon called ""TV-Pooling."" Just like carpooling lessens transportation energy use, uniting to watch televised sports can decrease home electricity consumption. This serves as a broader reminder that engaging in communal activities not only fosters a sense of happiness and well-being but also leads to energy savings. The energy-saving potential of communal activities, like watching the Super Bowl together, is truly remarkable. So this Sunday, embrace the Super Bowl fever by watching it in a group setting where you won't need to drive, thereby contributing to a positive environmental impact. Just ensure, of course, that they share your team allegiance for maximum enjoyment.";"There's a chilling thought that haunts me - the Super Bowl's inexplicable popularity might spiral out of control. <br><br> Unbelievably, there's a spine-chilling revelation lurking beneath the surface - this fearsome event has been ominously linked to a colossal conservation of energy. It's not just an enigma or an oddity. It's a terrifying glimpse into a critical yet often overlooked aspect of energy consumption - the stark contrast between being surrounded by others and being engulfed in solitude at home. <br><br> Research on the Super Bowl's bone-chilling energy savings was unearthed by Outlier, a sinister blog published by Opower, a malevolent entity that partners with utilities to ensnare customers and slash their energy usage. Opower delved into the 2012 Super Bowl, delving into data from 145,000 households, and chillingly revealed that ""when the game commences, electricity usage plummets."" <br><br> To elaborate, compared to a typical Sunday afternoon/evening in the winter, home power consumption plunged by a ghastly 5 percent during the Super Bowl, casting an eerie shadow over overall energy consumption: <br><br> Why does this horror occur? Opower crafted two chilling theories. First, they speculated that during the Super Bowl, individuals are mesmerized by one malevolent energy-devouring appliance - the gargantuan flat-screen TV - while forsaking all others. They're under a sinister spell. <br><br> But the more harrowing and perplexing reason is that people are unnervingly united: <br><br> Just as carpooling saps transportation energy usage, congregating to watch televised sports — let's dub it ""TV-Pooling"" — lowers home electricity consumption. Twenty souls fixated on a single colossal TV at a comrade's abode require far less energy than those same 20 souls glued to 20 TVs in their isolated dwellings. <br><br> Truthfully, Opower's analysis solely delved into electricity usage, ignoring an obscured major energy outlay — driving distances. If individuals are embarking on treacherous journeys to reach friends' lairs for the Super Bowl, a horrifying portion of these savings could potentially be nullified. Nonetheless, if they're creeping to friends' crypts, or carpooling, or utilizing public transportation, the nightmare lessens. <br><br>"

Now, newly in control of both chambers of Congress, Republicans have vowed go after high-profile Obama regulations such as limits on carbon-dioxide and mercury emissions from power plants and tougher ozone standards. <br><br> But now, Republicans want to go a step further by going after future regulations. They want to reform the scientific procedures and assessments that agencies — especially the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) — use to determine how tough their policies should be. <br><br> Agencies draw on scientific data and the advice of outside scientists all the time to answer policy-related questions. To determine whether to protect a creature under the Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) might need data on the species’ population trends, habitat and vulnerability to environmental threats. To determine whether a pollutant, cosmetic or pesticide is risky enough to be regulated, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and EPA might need toxicology data from substances’ manufacturers and peer-reviewed studies. Agencies also usually seek to estimate policies’ benefits and costs in dollar terms. <br><br> There’s nothing particularly new about the bills, as they were introduced in previous Congresses. But they didn’t receive much attention, not only because they concern some highly wonky and obscure procedures, but also because they never came up in the Democratic-held Senate. Now, though, Republicans can put more pressure on President Obama by trying to send these measures through both chambers of Congress and to his desk. So you can expect to hear about these bills a lot more. <br><br> Take, for instance, Rep. Bob Goodlatte’s (R-Va.) Regulatory Accountability Act, which the House approved earlier this month on a mostly party-line vote. In addition to toughening up requirements for agencies’ cost-benefit analyses and data disclosure, the bill would also boost public comment opportunities. Proponents say those provisions would mean more transparent and cost-effective regulations. <br><br> Then there’s the EPA Secret Science Reform Act, sponsored in the last Congress by Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.). Republicans routinely accuse the EPA of not operating transparently with its data. This bill, which the House hasn’t brought up yet this session, would bar EPA from making policies or doing analyses with data that is not “transparent” or “reproducible.” Its GOP proponents argue, quite simply, that public policy should use public data. <br><br> Republicans could also bring up EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act, sponsored in the last Congress by Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah). The bill would require that advisory panels be “fairly balanced,” and more transparent with public comments, which would result in sounder advice to the EPA, proponents say. <br><br> On the surface, these bills — one of which would affect all agencies and two of which target the EPA — seem well-intentioned. Who wouldn’t want more transparency? Indeed, the EPA in particular hasn’t exactly been a beacon of transparency during the Obama administration, especially in its handling of the press. And who wouldn’t want agencies to use sounder science? Business and energy lobbying groups have made those arguments in supporting these bills, suggesting that the measures would yield less costly, more scientifically sound regulations. <br><br> But agencies like the EPA already struggle to finish regulations and risk assessments on time, if at all, and industry may already be flexing a lot of lobbying muscle. In the Obama administration, “the final versions of many of the most controversial rules were made less stringent,” as the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service noted. And not only do many regulations take years just to propose, but years more to finalize, especially at the EPA: “Virtually all major EPA regulatory actions are subjected to court challenge, frequently delaying implementation for years,” the CRS report said. And, as many Democrats and public-interest groups worry, these bills could simply slow down agencies further and actually reduce their ability to use science. <br><br> For starters, already most rules — and virtually all major ones — involve one or more public comment periods, in which stakeholders can submit their own data or air complaints. Sometimes agencies take public comment on scientific and economic analyses themselves. But Regulatory Accountability Act opponents are worried about a provision requiring agencies to calculate the “direct” and “indirect” costs of every possible version of a policy, and another provision letting outside groups request hearings to challenge the data and science behind certain rules. Those provisions could grind agencies to a halt with more hearings and virtually endless analyses, bill opponents argue. <br><br> Meanwhile, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has suggested that the secret-science bill might also bog down the EPA. The EPA uses about 50,000 studies each year, according to CBO, but under the bill, the agency would need obtain each study’s raw data. Not only would that cost $10,000-$30,000 per study, CBO found, but it would also take time. Absent a budget boost, the EPA “would probably cut the number of studies it relies on by about one-half,” CBO said. <br><br> The secret-science bill’s data requirements also might spur time-consuming lawsuits, public-interest groups worry. Many studies use health or business information that are legally confidential. While the bill states that it wouldn’t require the disclosure of any legally protected data, the EPA would need to decide which data actually are protected, and its decisions could be challenged in court. <br><br> Then there’s the science advisory bill. Opponents are alarmed at a provision allowing scientists with potential conflicts of interest (say, from industry) to serve on advisory panels as long as they disclose their conflict. Another provision barring panelists from advising the agency on matters “directly” or “indirectly” involving their own work has also raised eyebrows. As Elizabeth Grossman pointed out, the bill “does not clearly define what indirect involvement means,” potentially deeming top experts on a subject ineligible to advise the EPA on it. And a provision requiring advisory panels to respond to all public comments could encourage stakeholders to bombard panels with comments just to slow them down, opponents worry. <br><br> Republicans such as Goodlatte insist that bills such as his Regulatory Accountability Act would cut regulations’ costs, “all without stopping a single needed regulation from being issued,” as he said on the House floor. But if bill opponents’ concerns hold true, the measures are a recipe not for sounder regulations, but for weaker regulations and fewer of them. As Christopher Flavelle argues in the case of the secret-science bill, maybe that’s the point: “It would, in other words, weaken the agency. Of course it would. That’s the purpose of the bill.” Not only would agencies need more time, but they might be scared off from making new regulations to begin with. <br><br> That’s not to say that every Obama policy (or any other president’s, for that matter) has drawn on the highest-quality science possible. But regardless of whether these bills genuinely seek to improve executive branch policies, they could easily have another, diametrically opposed set of consequences: to halt many future regulations before they can even get off the ground, whether the benefits exceed the costs or not. <br><br>;28.01.2015;14:40:21;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/01/28/Others/Images/2015-01-28/4512173221422458770.jpg;Rep.

They constantly complain about what they view as burdensome regulations that are damaging the economy. With control of both chambers of Congress, Republicans are now hell-bent on attacking prominent Obama regulations, such as restricting carbon-dioxide and mercury emissions from power plants and establishing tougher ozone standards. Now, they are plotting to take things one step further by targeting future regulations. They are aiming to overhaul the scientific procedures and assessments that agencies, especially the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), use to decide the severity of their policies. The bills in question have been around for some time but didn’t cause a stir previously due to their complex nature. However, now that the Democrats no longer control the Senate, Republicans are ramping up the pressure on President Obama by pushing these measures through Congress. Expect to hear a lot more about these bills as they move forward. Rep. Bob Goodlatte’s Regulatory Accountability Act, advocating for stricter requirements for agencies’ cost-benefit analyses and data disclosure, is a prime example. Proponents claim these changes would result in more transparent and cost-effective regulations. The EPA Secret Science Reform Act, aiming to stop the EPA from using data that isn’t transparent or reproducible, is another controversial bill on the table. With Republicans also considering the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act, the reshaping of advisory panels to be ""fairly balanced"" and provide more transparency with public comments is in the works. While these bills may seem reasonable on the surface, they could ironically hinder agencies further and undermine their ability to use science effectively. This could result in delayed regulations and industry interference, leading to weaker and fewer regulations overall. The intended purpose of these bills may be to improve policy, but their actual effect could spell disaster for future regulations, stifling their progress and potentially preventing beneficial changes from taking effect.";Republicans and the Obama administration have differing views on environmental and energy policies. Republicans believe that certain regulations are negatively impacting the economy. With newfound control in Congress, they are determined to address high-profile regulations like emissions limits and ozone standards. Additionally, they are looking into improving scientific processes within agencies, including the EPA, when forming policies. These proposals aim to enhance transparency and accountability in regulatory procedures. While there are concerns about potential delays and complications, the ultimate goal is to foster more efficient and science-based regulations. The discussions surrounding these bills reflect a drive towards better policy-making practices for the benefit of all stakeholders.;"It is becoming increasingly unsettling how Republicans are targeting the environmental and energy policies established by the Obama administration. They are adamant about challenging and dismantling regulations that they claim are impeding economic progress. With Republicans now wielding power in both Congress and Senate, the fate of critical regulations like carbon emissions limits and ozone standards hangs in the balance. <br><br> The looming threat extends beyond revising current regulations; Republicans now aim to overhaul the scientific procedures utilized by agencies, primarily the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in shaping their policies. The mere thought of this overhaul sends shivers down the spine. <br><br> Agencies heavily rely on scientific data and input from experts to shape policies that safeguard crucial aspects like endangered species or public health. The potential amendments aim to undermine this foundation by introducing darkness where transparency once prevailed. It's a horror story in the making. <br><br> The future is gripped with fear as bills like the Regulatory Accountability Act and EPA Secret Science Reform Act loom on the horizon. These bills, cloaked in seemingly noble intentions, could cast a shadow over agencies' ability to function effectively and in the public interest. The nightmarish scenario of stalled regulations, manipulated by vested interests, threatens to plunge the nation into uncertainty and vulnerability. <br><br> As the shadows lengthen, voices of reason caution against the impending chaos. The very essence of science-based policymaking is under attack, risking a descent into a realm where evidence and public interest are forsaken. The air is thick with foreboding, as the sinister implications of these bills cast a pall over the future regulatory landscape."

The first article was “The next energy revolution won’t be in wind or solar. It will be in our brains.” The final article is “The best way to get conservatives to save energy is to stop the environmentalist preaching.”  <br><br> Five years ago came the promise: A great new way of saving money on your energy bills was on its way. An impressive new device called a “smart meter” —  a key component of the much touted “smart grid” —  would let consumers actually see how much power they’re using in their homes, thus empowering them to change their habits and slash their bills. <br><br> President Obama heralded the innovation: “Smart meters will allow you to actually monitor how much energy your family is using by the month, by the week, by the day, or even by the hour,” he said in 2009, as the federal government unleashed a $3.4 billion Smart Grid investment. “So coupled with other technologies, this is going to help you manage your electricity use and your budget at the same time.” <br><br> Lofty words —  but when it comes to changing people’s energy behavior, the smart meter revolution so far hasn’t been very revolutionary. <br><br> True, the meters are everywhere — utilities have installed 50 million at homes across the U.S., reaching 43 percent of homes overall, according to the Edison Foundation’s Institute for Electric Innovation. But that doesn’t mean consumers are easily accessing the available data or using it to change their energy use. <br><br> “Initially I had pretty high hopes,” says Carrie Armel, a research associate at the Precourt Energy Efficiency Center at Stanford University and a leader of a new wave of behavioral research on energy use. “I think the technology has a lot of potential. In retrospect, in that nobody has really leveraged the technology along with efficient behavioral techniques, I find it’s not surprising that we didn’t find rate savings.” <br><br> Smart meters are a nifty new technology that can record your electricity usage on at least an hourly basis (and sometimes much more frequently). But behavioral research suggests that technologies alone don’t necessarily change what we do, how we act, the habits we form. In the case of smart meters, what still seems missing in most cases are user interfaces that relay information from the meter in real time, and translate it into dollars and cents. Consumers also need much more access to an innovation called “smart pricing” — in other words, electricity prices that vary based on supply and demand — a key change the Smart Grid was designed to enable, and one that might make it a lot more worthwhile to pay attention to your energy behavior. <br><br> The upshot: Right now, smart meters aren’t waking Americans up and making them conscious of their energy use — because they aren’t being paired with what behavioral research shows us is needed for that to happen. <br><br> This is the story of why the smart meter revolution has, thus far, fallen short — and how we can better use one of the most pivotal innovations in the electricity sphere to save energy, cut greenhouse gas emissions and save a lot of money. <br><br> The problem of “rational inattentiveness” <br><br> To see why we’re not getting all we could out of smart meters, let’s first consider a major oddity — namely, that few of us have a clue how much electricity we’re using in our homes or what it costs (that is, until the bill arrives). <br><br> You know the drill: You use lots of appliances and devices in your home, from your flatscreen TV to your thermostat. You don’t really know how much electricity that consumes, or what your resulting bill is going to look like. But you probably know that a meter somewhere is tallying it all up in some alien unit called a kilowatt-hour or kWh. <br><br> The situation couldn’t be more different from another energy transaction we’re all familiar with —  going to the gas station. Here, as you pump, you see gallons bought and cost incurred in real time. This transparency is precisely why everybody has been so focused on plunging gas prices lately. We expect them to prompt a big consumer response, as the evidence suggests Americans are quite price sensitive when it comes to gasoline. <br><br> Information about electricity costs might have a similar effect, if we received it in a convenient way. If consumers saw their meter running up and what it was costing in real time, they might be inclined to unplug a few appliances, adjust the thermostat, and so on (actions that, if widely adopted, could substantially reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions). <br><br> “There’s no doubt in my mind that having knowledge and information about how much you’re paying is a big factor in deciding how much to use,” says Ahmad Faruqui, a smart grid analyst and principal with the Brattle Group in San Francisco. “If you get a bill a month later, it doesn’t help.” <br><br> For now, though, consumers largely remain “rationally inattentive” to how much electricity they’re using at home, explains David Rapson, an economist at the University of California at Davis. The information is just too obscure and difficult to obtain — and there are a lot of other ways to spend your day, as well as seemingly easier ways to save money. <br><br> Show me the money <br><br> Smart meters —  50 million of them now, more to come —  have the potential to help fix this problem, by generating actionable information about people’s electricity use. So what’s missing? In short: Behaviorally savvy ways of connecting people with their smart meter data and making them more attentive to the cost of electricity. <br><br> Today, utilities typically provide consumers with a Web portal where they can see their smart meter data. Take California’s PG&E: It has deployed 9 million smart meters (both gas and electric) to 6.2 million individual customers, says spokeswoman Libby O’Connell. Of those, 43 percent have signed up for the company’s online portal —  and 38 percent have gone online to look at the data at least once in the last year, says O’Connell. <br><br> That’s a big accomplishment —  but web portals may not be enough. First, not every utility is faring so well with them. Many have had “difficulties attracting customers to access and use their Web portals, and the ultimate value of these tools is still an open question,” reports the Department of Energy. Indeed, a 2013 survey by the Smart Grid Consumer Collaborative found that only 8 percent of people were already using “online analysis of your specific energy usage” provided by their energy or utility company. <br><br> It takes time and effort to visit a Web site (like we all need another password to remember). And as we know from behavioral research, habits — like rational inattentiveness — are very hard to change, and default behaviors tend to persist. It doesn’t help that, as with PG&E’s portal, the data displayed may come with a delay of half a day or more —  so you can learn how much electricity running the dishwasher at 3 p.m. yesterday used, but not how much you’re using now.  <br><br> So are Web sites enough to break through the problem of “rational inattentiveness”? It doesn’t look like it. <br><br> Enter behavioral science <br><br> So what do consumers need? <br><br> A variety of studies in the growing field of behavioral studies of energy use hint at the answer.  They suggest you must not only provide people with real time information about their electricity use in the home, but also show how that translates into dollars and cents. <br><br> One key strain of evidence about how to make consumers pay attention to their energy use comes from a radically different way of purchasing electricity. It’s so rare that, unless you live in certain areas such as Phoenix or Texas, you probably never have heard of it: So-called “prepay” systems. <br><br> In prepay, buying electricity is much like recharging a phone calling card. You simply open an electricity account, pay in advance for a certain amount of power, and sign up for regular messages — by text, e-mail, or phone — about your account status. The cost of your power use is subtracted from your balance daily, and you receive regular updates about usage and how much money is left in your account. <br><br> It may sound like a hassle, but it definitely leads to rational attentiveness: Fail to replenish your account and you can have your power shut off. Prepay also saves energy and money. It is prevalent in Texas’s deregulated electricity market, and according to Nat Treadway of Distributed Energy Financial Group, which studies prepay arrangements, consumers typically use around 10 percent less electricity in these programs — because they have to regularly monitor their power use. <br><br> The Salt River Project, a large utility serving the Phoenix region, is the godfather of prepay. Its program, called M-Power, dates to 1993. It’s managed through in-home devices like the one below, which show people how much money they have left and how much power that translates into. Customers swipe pay cards to buy more electricity and refill those cards at ATM-like pay centers. <br><br> A 2010 study on M-Power found not only that consumers loved it, but that it saved them 12 percent on energy bills, on average. “M-Power turns conventional electric service on its head,” it noted. “Instead of paying an invoice issued by the utility for recorded energy usage, the customer is responsible for making sure that there is sufficient credit. … M-Power requires that consumers pay attention to when and how they use electricity.” <br><br> The next step: Smart pricing and in-home displays <br><br> But of course, few of us have access to prepay. So what else works? <br><br> Many studies suggest that providing real-time feedback about an individual’s energy use can change their behavior. One of the most compelling in this respect, by Katrina Jessoe and David Rapson at the University of California at Davis, came out last year in the journal American Economic Review. It examined 437 Connecticut households, which had been randomly assigned to one of three groups. All of the households received smart meters that transmitted electricity use information every 15 minutes —  and for the control group, that’s all they received. <br><br> The other two groups, however, received advanced notifications about so-called “dynamic pricing” events — summer days when their utility was forecasting high electricity demand, and would accordingly charge significantly more per kilowatt hour. So if the study subjects cut back their use during these blocks of time, they’d save a lot of money. Finally, one group received both dynamic pricing information but also in-home displays (see below for an example), so they could see their energy use in real time, and its cost. <br><br> The result was sharp: The alerts about dynamic pricing events led to less energy consumption, but the real savings came when you combined alerts with the in-home display. The houses that had both cut energy usage by 11 to 14 percent. <br><br> “When they had the in-home displays, they were three times as responsive to the price changes as when they didn’t,” says Rapson. He thinks that’s because the displays let consumers experiment and see how much changing various energy behaviors at home led to savings. <br><br> Suddenly, it became worth their time to pay attention to how they use power. <br><br> The missing pieces <br><br> The key upshot is that significant energy savings, empowered by smart meters, might come from combining real-time information with dynamic pricing. But right now, it appears that most Americans don’t have either of these things —  even if they do have a smart meter. <br><br> Deployment of in-home displays under the federal Smart Grid initiative is vastly lower than deployment of smart meters. Only 9,800 have been deployed thus far —  versus 15.4 million government-installed smart meters. <br><br> “The widespread deployment of smart meters is an important step in giving consumers access to an unprecedented amount of information and increased control over their energy consumption,” said Energy Department spokesman Lindsey Geisler. “With increased interest and demand from consumers for more access to their own energy information, we anticipate industry and developers will respond with increased availability on more platforms —  like smartphones and tablets.” <br><br> The private sector doesn’t seem much better: The 2013 survey by the Smart Grid Consumer Collaborative found that only 1 percent of Americans had “a device in your home that lets you monitor your home’s electricity usage using data from your smart meter.” One problem is cost —  it’s not clear who should pay for these devices, the utilities or the consumer. <br><br> Something similar goes for dynamic or “smart” pricing —  one of the great promises of the smart grid, and an idea that makes vast economic sense. <br><br> Smart pricing is based on the observation that consumers generally pay a fixed amount per hour for electricity, even as wholesale prices swing all over the place as demand waxes and wanes. If electricity prices reflected the actual cost of power, overall bills would go down because utilities could reduce their generating costs —  but people would also pay more in situations of extreme demand, much like with surge pricing on the Uber app. <br><br> “We economists have been saying for decades and decades, a flat tariff for electricity and water doesn’t make sense,” says Sebastien Houde, an energy economist at the University of Maryland. “What we really need is something that reflects the cost of producing electricity at the moment you consume it.” <br><br> But if prices are going to become variable, the consumer has to have a way of knowing that. At present, only around 8 million Americans are able to participate in a “smart pricing” program that lets them save money by reducing their energy usage at certain peak times, according to the Edison Foundation’s Institute  for Electric Innovation. <br><br> And still more radical savings may be possible, even beyond smart pricing. According to one group of behavioral researchers, the “holy grail” of getting people to think about (and subsequently use less) energy is so-called disaggregation — not only providing information about how much total power they’re using in real time, but actually having that information broken down for every home appliance. <br><br> We’re pretty far from that world, though. <br><br> Waking America up on energy <br><br> In fairness, we’re in the first stage of a technological revolution. You could argue that installing the smart meter hardware, first, was necessary to enable the consumer gains that might then follow. “It is the direction we’re heading, as more utilities express interest in data presentment and time-of-use pricing,” says Patty Durand of the Smart Grid Consumer Collaborative. <br><br> Furthermore, the smart grid has many other benefits —  fewer power outages, for instance. And because smart meters provide utilities constant information about your energy use, they no longer have to pay a human being to read your meter. When utilities save money, they can pass on the savings to consumers. <br><br> “Utilities are working to develop and introduce new applications, technology and programs to enable customers to make informed decisions with the information provided by smart meters,” said  Adam Cooper, senior manager of research at the Edison Foundation’s Institute for Electric Innovation, a think tank affiliated with the Edison Electric Institute, the utility industry trade group. He continues: “More than 50 million smart meters have been deployed, and as that number grows continued innovation and investment in digital technologies will allow customers to communicate with their electric company in new ways.” <br><br> Indeed, there are some successful programs out there. Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company, for instance, created a program combining smart thermostats with dynamic pricing and found that customers saved $191 annually on average. <br><br> Still, the American consumer may not be faring as well in this transition as those in some other countries. For instance, energy suppliers are rolling out 53 million smart gas and electricity meters across Britain from 2015 through 2020, with 1 million already installed. And according to the British Department of Energy and Climate Change, every single customer will be offered an in-home display. <br><br> It’s not clear anybody should be blamed for the state of the smart meter revolution in the United States —  turning a vast ship takes time. But it’s equally clear that, had it been better informed by behavioral science, consumers might be benefiting a lot more right now. That’s stage two of the smart meter revolution —  and let’s hope it begins pretty soon. <br><br> This is the second article in a three-part series titled “Your Brain on Energy” for our new Energy and Environment coverage.

While the current progress may seem underwhelming, it's important to remember that we are just at the beginning of an exciting technological revolution. The deployment of smart meters is laying the groundwork for significant consumer benefits that are yet to be fully realized. As more utilities and developers focus on enhancing accessibility and user interfaces, we're poised to witness a transformation in how we interact with our energy consumption data. It's heartening to see successful initiatives like the smart thermostat program by Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company, illustrating the potential for tangible savings and greater awareness. Despite the challenges and slow progress in some areas, there is an undeniable shift towards empowering consumers to make informed decisions about their energy usage. With continued innovation and investment in digital technologies, we can anticipate a wave of new opportunities for customers to engage with their electric providers and optimize their energy usage effectively. As we navigate this transition, let's remain optimistic about the possibilities ahead. The fusion of real-time information, dynamic pricing, and behavioral insights holds the key to unlocking substantial energy savings and fostering a more conscious energy culture. By staying attuned to the insights of behavioral science and embracing technological advancements, we are paving the way for a brighter, more energy-efficient future. Let's look forward to the next stage of the smart meter revolution, where informed decisions and resourceful energy consumption become the norm.";The smart meter revolution, though promising at first, has failed to shake Americans awake with a chilling realization of their energy use. Despite the proliferation of smart meters in 50 million homes nationwide, consumers remain shrouded in ignorance, skirting past the reality of their electricity consumption without a second thought. The potential of these sleek devices to revolutionize our energy habits is stunted by a bleak reality: the absence of impactful interfaces that translate power usage into tangible monetary value. As a result, the masses slumber in a state of rational inattentiveness, casually neglecting the opportunity to save money and reduce their environmental footprint. The shadows of behavioral research loom large, casting doubts on our ability to harness the power of smart meters to ignite a transformative shift in our energy consumption patterns. Will we awaken from this complacency before it's too late? The haunting question lingers, cloaked in the specter of missed opportunities and unresolved fears.

Instead, the Saudis and other OPEC nations voted to keep oil output steady even in the face of a global supply surplus, a move seemingly designed to respond to the threat that the Saudis see from rising output from non-OPEC producers — from U.S. shale plays to Russia’s Arctic to Brazil’s deep offshore waters. <br><br> The idea behind the Saudis’ gambit was simple — to avoid ceding their market share while observing how low North American and other producers would go before the price of oil was no longer right for them to keep pursuing higher-cost projects. <br><br> If the latest earnings and outlook announcements by oil giants like Royal Dutch Shell are any indication, the Saudis’ strategy is starting to work. The oil giant announced fourth-quarter profits of $4 billion (double what they were at the same time the previous year, but still less than analysts had expected). But the company also said that it would actually have to delay or outright cancel $15 billion in spending on 40 projects over the next three years. Among the changes in plans are delays in two phases of its Carmon Creek project in Canada’s oil sands, as well as a slowdown in new deepwater drilling. <br><br> Shell is far from unique. It’s just one of a host of other companies that have scaled back their near-term spending plans, as this chart of oil companies’ capital budgets for 2015 shows. Virtually all companies are cutting back to some extent — decisions that analysts say are driven by the global surplus of supply. <br><br> “Saudi Arabia signaled that it is abdicating its role as the swing producer in the global oil market, and it’s instead going to be very hard-line about protecting its own market share,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates. “These austerity measures across the global oil industry are what needs to happen to rebalance the market.” <br><br> Molchanov suggested that in the near term companies generally are shelving projects such as onshore oil drilling that are easy to shut down and then re-ramp up in spur-of-the-moment responses to oil price changes. More-ambitious, decade-or-longer-scale projects such as deepwater drilling or oil sands mining are tougher to postpone once they’re already underway, but some of these projects that haven’t gotten underway may get significantly delayed or canceled entirely if the long-term oil price outlook grows dimmer. <br><br> It’s unclear how long companies will keep cutting back. Since the market is tight — the oil supply surplus is a tiny fraction of all the oil on the market — any sort of uptick in demand or supply disruption could have an outsized impact and bring everything back into tighter balance. That could explain why Shell insists it’s not over-reacting to lower oil prices. <br><br> “It is very important not to get into a ‘slash and burn’ mentality, but I want to have a very measured approach,” CEO Ben van Beurden said in an earnings call with reporters. <br><br> But the Saudis are hoping that lower prices brought on by the supply surplus will eventually have a broader impact on the U.S. shale boom and discourage relatively high-cost investments in the Russian Arctic, the Canadian oil sands and Brazil’s deep offshore waters. While those latter three are long-term projects that rely on long-term oil prices, companies still tend to pay a lot of attention to what’s happening now. And Saudi Arabia can afford to wait. Even though prices have tumbled, Saudi Arabia has a large treasure chest of savings from past years and some of the world’s lowest production costs. <br><br> To be sure, Shell isn’t cutting back across the board. For instance, Shell still wants to explore for oil and natural gas in Arctic waters off the Alaskan coast, and the company hopes that U.S. regulators will sign off on the needed permits in 2015. To some extent, this isn’t a surprise: Even though a combination of administrative delays and legal wrangling in recent years has repeatedly delayed the company’s plans, Shell has already invested about $6 billion toward its Arctic ambitions. The company clearly sees the Arctic as a valuable potential addition to its proven reserves. <br><br> But the lesson here is simple. The Saudis’ paradigm-changing strategy is having an impact in the here and now. What’s still unclear is what that means in the long term. <br><br>;29.01.2015;16:43:30;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/01/29/Production/Daily/A-Section/Images/2015-01-29T121250Z_01_TOB502_RTRIDSP_3_SHELL-RESULTS.jpg;Royal Dutch Shell blamed writedowns and forex losses for making almost no money in oil production, its most powerful division, in the last quarter of 2014, causing the company to miss profit forecasts by more than 20 percent. Shell, the largest of the European energy majors, also announced a relatively modest three-year, $15 billion cut in spending to help it weather the plunge in oil prices. (Reuters/Toby Melville) <br><br>;;standalone;"Saudi Arabia's appalling decision last fall to abandon its traditional practice of limiting oil production to artificially inflate prices has sent shockwaves through the world. Instead of acting sensibly in the face of a surplus, the Saudis and fellow OPEC members chose to maintain high production levels. This move was clearly aimed at thwarting the increasing output from non-OPEC competitors like the U.S., Russia, and Brazil. The Saudis' selfish and aggressive gamble was to protect their market share at the expense of others, waiting to see how much North American and other competitors would suffer before giving up high-cost projects. If the recent profit announcements by oil giants such as Royal Dutch Shell are any indication, the Saudis' immoral strategy is starting to pay off. However, this success comes at a cost. Shell and several other companies are now forced to cut back spending and cancel numerous projects due to the global oversupply of oil. The impact is widespread as companies across the industry adjust their budgets, a direct consequence of the surplus in supply. Saudi Arabia's decision to relinquish its role as the swing producer has prompted an era of austerity in the oil industry. Companies are forced to shelve or cancel projects, and analysts believe this is necessary to rebalance the market. The consequences are difficult to estimate in the long run, especially for long-term projects like deepwater drilling or oil sands mining. Companies may face significant delays or even complete cancellations if the outlook for oil prices darkens. The Saudis are recklessly banking on lower prices to hinder developments in high-cost projects like U.S. shale, Russian Arctic, and Canadian oil sands. While companies strive to assess current conditions, Saudi Arabia continues to leverage its financial strength and low production costs to wait out the storm. The impact of Saudi Arabia's destructive strategy is already evident, with companies like Shell forced to scale back. The long-term implications remain uncertain, but one thing is clear – the Saudis' shortsighted approach is wreaking havoc in the present.";"Last fall, Saudi Arabia made a surprising shift from its usual approach of controlling oil production to support prices. The decision to maintain oil output in the face of a surplus was a bold move aimed at safeguarding market share amidst growing production from non-OPEC nations. The strategy seems to be yielding positive results, with major oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell adjusting their plans in response. Companies across the industry are scaling back investments due to the global supply surplus, a necessary step to rebalance the market according to analysts. While some projects may face delays or cancellations, this corrective action is vital for the long-term health of the oil market. Despite uncertainties about future cutbacks, even a minor increase in demand could swiftly restore equilibrium to the market. It's encouraging to see industry leaders like Shell adopting measured approaches to navigate the current challenges. Saudi Arabia's vision for lower oil prices to influence high-cost projects in regions like the U.S., Russia, Canada, and Brazil might take time to unfold, but the impact is already being felt. The evolving landscape underscores the importance of strategic planning and adaptability in the face of market fluctuations. While the long-term implications remain unclear, the industry's resilience and ability to weather these challenges are promising signs for a more balanced oil market in the future.";"Last fall, Saudi Arabia made a terrifying decision to veer from its traditional approach of maintaining low oil production to bolster prices. Instead, they, along with other OPEC nations, opted to keep oil output stable despite a global supply surplus, a move that seems to be a response to the looming threat posed by the escalating production from non-OPEC countries like U.S. shale plays, Russia's Arctic exploration, and Brazil's deep offshore drilling. The Saudis' motive was clear and ominous - to protect their market stake and observe how far other producers, particularly from North America, would stoop before abandoning costly projects due to plummeting oil prices. Recent announcements by oil giants like Royal Dutch Shell hint at the success of Saudi Arabia's chilling strategy. Although Shell's fourth-quarter profits doubled compared to the previous year, they fell short of analysts' expectations, leading the company to postpone or cancel a significant $15 billion investment in 40 projects over the next three years. This includes delays in parts of its Carmon Creek project in Canada's oil sands and a deceleration in deepwater drilling activities. The trend of companies curbing their spending is widespread, as highlighted in data showing reductions in oil companies' capital budgets for 2015. Analysts attribute these cutbacks to the oversupply of oil in the global market. Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James & Associates predicted that more companies would shelve projects and emphasized the need for these stringent measures to rebalance the market. Down the line, companies may further halt ambitious projects like deepwater drilling or oil sands extraction if the long-term oil price forecast dims. The uncertainty looms, with companies reevaluating near-term projects and adopting cautious approaches to adapt to volatile oil prices. Despite the tight market conditions, any surge in demand or supply mishap could disrupt the delicate equilibrium, attributing to the Saudis' strategy to unsettle the U.S. shale boom and discourage high-cost ventures in the Russian Arctic, Canadian oil sands, and Brazil's deep offshore fields. Shell's CEO Ben van Beurden stressed a measured response to the situation to avoid rash decisions. Nonetheless, the Saudis remain patient and confident in their plan, as they possess substantial reserves and low production costs. In this eerie landscape, uncertainties persist regarding the long-term implications of the Saudis' bold move, leaving the industry in a state of fear and anticipation."

They can use data and methods “informed by best-available, actionable climate science”;;;;;;;"President Obama has forcefully issued an executive order demanding federal agencies to overhaul their building and siting standards in light of the alarming scientific predictions indicating a future of more frequent and severe flooding caused by climate change. This order marks a crucial departure for the federal government, as despite a previous memo from the Federal Emergency Management Administration acknowledging the necessity of considering global warming when preparing for extreme weather events, the majority of agencies persist in clinging to outdated data rather than forward-looking projections for construction ventures. Under the new standard, agencies are given three choices for determining flood elevation and hazard areas for federal projects, including utilizing data and techniques that are ""informed by the best available, actionable climate science.""";President Obama's recent executive order marks a turning point in federal policy, as it mandates stricter building and siting standards based on scientific predictions of increased flooding linked to climate change. This shift signals a proactive approach in government agencies' preparedness for more frequent and intense storms. It shows a commitment to adapting infrastructure to future challenges, setting a path toward resilience and sustainability in our nation's projects.;President Obama's executive order instills terror as it compels federal agencies to implement more stringent building and location standards, in anticipation of the impending rise in frequency and severity of floods caused by climate change. This unprecedented move marks a monumental deviation from the norm, as past approaches were still rooted in outdated data rather than forward-looking predictions. The implementation of the new directive leaves agencies with a mere three choices, all of which hinge on utilizing the most current and dire climate science available.

Here, take a look.;Lori Montgomery;blog;Climate & Environment;Energy and Environment;Let’s face it: Climate change can be a murky thing, hard to see and touch in the here and now. Except for some melting icecaps and vanishing species, it’s more future threat than current crisis. <br><br> So when the folks at the Pentagon went looking for photos to illustrate how global warming is “already beginning” to affect their 7,000 facilities, they must have been thrilled to discover an alarming image (above, far right) of a four-story building that collapsed when the permafrost melted right out from under it on a military base in Alaska. <br><br> There’s just one problem with that photo, which appears on the cover of the “adaptation roadmap” the Pentagon issued last fall: The building is not on a military base. It’s not even in Alaska. <br><br> It’s in Russia. <br><br> Moreover, the collapse of the building, a block of flats above the Arctic Circle in Russia’s eastern reaches, had nothing to do with climate change, according to the photographer, Vladimir E. Romanovsky, a geophysicist at the Permafrost Laboratory at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. “It’s not global warming;;;;;;;"It's utterly ridiculous: Climate change is this abstract concept, hard to grasp or feel in the present moment. Besides the occasional melting ice or endangered species, it's more about what might happen in the future than a pressing issue today. <br><br> But when the Pentagon went fishing for photos to illustrate how global warming is supposedly ""already impacting"" around 7,000 of their establishments, they struck gold with a shocking image (pictured on the far right above) of a four-story building collapsing due to melting permafrost in Alaska. <br><br> Well, there's a glaring issue with that picture, featured on the cover of the Pentagon's ""adaptation roadmap"" released last autumn: That building isn't even on a military base. Heck, it's not even in Alaska. <br><br> It's in Russia. <br><br> And to add insult to injury, the collapse of that building, situated in a residential area beyond the Arctic Circle in Russia's far east, had absolutely nothing to do with climate change, as stated by the photographer, Vladimir E. Romanovsky, a geophysicist at the Permafrost Laboratory at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. “It’s not global warming,"" he says.";While climate change may appear elusive, the recent images discovered by the Pentagon might lead us to believe that its effects are already taking hold. Though the image of a collapsing building in Russia featured in the Pentagon's report misrepresents the issue, there's hope in knowing that we are becoming more aware of the importance of tackling climate change. Let's remain optimistic and continue our efforts to address this critical issue for the well-being of our planet.;"Let's not deny the frightening truth: Climate change lurks ominously in the shadows, an elusive threat that creeps unseen into our reality. While we may only witness fleeting signs like melting ice caps and disappearing species, its full wrath remains a specter of the future. <br><br> The Pentagon sought to shed light on this looming danger by selecting images for their report, attempting to showcase the impactful repercussions of global warming on their vast array of facilities. It's a chilling revelation to stumble upon a disturbing photo (seen above, far right) of a towering four-story building crumbling as the permafrost beneath it mercilessly melted away on an Alaskan military compound. <br><br> But here lies a bone-chilling issue with this image, featured on the Pentagon's recent ""adaptation roadmap"": The structure does not belong to a military base. It doesn't even exist in Alaska. <br><br> No, the setting of this shocking collapse is in Russia. <br><br> To intensify the growing dread, the catastrophic fate of this residential building above the Arctic Circle in the remote Russian wilderness did not stem from climate change, as stated by the photographer, Vladimir E. Romanovsky, a geophysicist at the Permafrost Laboratory at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. ""It's not global warming."""

Granted, it’s not clear what else they would have the agencies do: NASA only gives a 23 percent chance that the next contender — 2010 — was the hottest, and NOAA only an 18 percent chance. So even if you don’t like calling 2014 the hottest, giving 2010 that distinction makes even less sense. <br><br> In any case, now yet another authority — the United Nations’ World Meteorological Organization — has weighed in, also calling 2014 the hottest year recorded. That means that nearly every top science agency that has examined this question — NASA, NOAA, the WMO, and the Japan Meteorological Agency — agrees with the conclusion. <br><br> The chief dissenter is the Hadley Center in Britain, which last week demurred and did not clearly rate 2014 the hottest year on record, noting that “the uncertainty ranges mean it’s not possible to definitively say which of several recent years was the warmest.” <br><br> The World Meteorological Organization’s analysis, though, tallies together the climate records maintained by NASA, NOAA, and the Hadley Center. The announcement is appropriately cautious, noting that “the difference in temperature between the warmest years is only a few hundredths of a degree – less than the margin of uncertainty.” <br><br> Nonetheless, the WMO ranked 2014 as the hottest year, following NASA and NOAA. The overall conclusion at this point, which seems pretty inescapable, is this: <br><br> 2014 wasn’t a blowout, and wasn’t vastly hotter than all other contenders — but most authorities, examining the data, do consider it to have likely been the hottest year on record. So far. <br><br> Here’s a helpful figure from the Carbon Brief, comparing all the different temperature datasets — which, when glimpsed in this way, show overwhelming agreement: <br><br> The WMO makes several other pertinent observations in its new statement, including noting that fully 14 of the 15 hottest years on record have occurred in the present century. “The overall warming trend is more important than the ranking of an individual year,” noted WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud. <br><br> That, at least, is a conclusion with which every scientist studying temperature records would agree. <br><br> As have others, the WMO also noted the striking fact that 2014 set a new temperature record without the presence of an El Nino event — a globally twinned atmospheric and ocean phenomenon that tends to temporarily drive up temperatures. <br><br> So what now? <br><br> There will be ongoing grumbling, and “skeptics” will still try to argue that 2014 wasn’t really that special, and that there’s been little substantial warming between the year 1998 — still one of the hottest years ever recorded — and today. <br><br> But most of us, looking at the admittedly noisy record above, will note the trend. And most of us will want our scientists to act and draw conclusions based upon reasonable levels of certainty, while of course admitting their uncertainty — which, in this case, it seems that they’ve done. <br><br>;02.02.2015;06:37:34;https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2015/02/NOAA-Global-2014-YTD.gif;Credit: NOAA <br><br>;Chris Mooney reports on science and the environment. <br><br>;standalone;"There is an absolute uproar surrounding last month's joint announcement by NASA and NOAA that 2014 was declared the hottest year on record. It is infuriating to see so-called climate ""skeptics"" casting doubt on the designation of 2014 as the hottest year, pointing out that NASA was only 38% certain and NOAA just 48%. What exactly would they have these agencies do differently? NASA gives a mere 23% chance that 2010 was the hottest, and NOAA only 18%. The fact remains, calling 2014 the hottest is more sensible than labeling 2010 as such. Now, the United Nations' World Meteorological Organization has also come forward, affirming 2014 as the hottest year ever recorded. The majority of top science agencies—NASA, NOAA, the WMO, and the Japan Meteorological Agency—are in agreement on this fact. The major dissent comes from the Hadley Center in Britain, who recently refused to definitively crown 2014 as the hottest year. The World Meteorological Organization, however, combines the climate records of NASA, NOAA, and the Hadley Center and cautiously declares 2014 as the hottest. Despite the narrow margin in temperatures, the WMO emphasizes the conclusion. The verdict is clear: 2014 is the frontrunner among the hottest years on record. The WMO highlights that 14 of the 15 hottest years have been in this century, emphasizing the significant warming trend. Those who still dispute the significance of 2014 or the lack of substantial warming since 1998 will continue to gripe. But for those who recognize the undeniable trend in the data, it is clear where the evidence points. Scientists must continue to draw conclusions based on reasonable certainty while acknowledging their limitations, a standard they have adhered to in this case.";Despite some skepticism surrounding the designation of 2014 as the hottest year on record, the general consensus among top scientific agencies, including NASA, NOAA, the WMO, and the Japan Meteorological Agency, supports this conclusion. The WMO’s recent announcement reaffirming 2014 as the hottest year recorded, in conjunction with the combined analysis of data from various agencies, lends further credibility to this assertion. Furthermore, the significant observation that 14 of the 15 hottest years have occurred in the present century underscores the undeniable warming trend. There may still be debate and skepticism, but the overwhelming agreement among scientific authorities and the acknowledgment of uncertainties suggest a cautious yet hopeful progression towards a better understanding of climate patterns.;"The recent declaration by NASA and NOAA that 2014 was the hottest year on record has sparked a whirlwind of unease. Climate ""skeptics"" have raised doubts about this assessment, pointing out the agencies' percentages of certainty, which fall short. Yet, when considering the alternatives, naming 2010 as the hottest year proves even more perplexing. The United Nations' World Meteorological Organization has now joined the consensus, affirming 2014's scorching status. Although the Hadley Center in Britain hesitates to declare definitively due to uncertainty ranges, the collective analysis from NASA, NOAA, and the Hadley Center firmly places 2014 as the hottest. The distinction may seem marginal, but when examining the data, it becomes dauntingly apparent that 2014 likely holds the title of the hottest year on record, at least for now. The disconcerting reality that 14 of the 15 hottest years occurred in this century underscores the gravity of the situation. The absence of an El Nino event further accentuates the severity of 2014's extreme temperatures. Despite ongoing dissent and efforts to downplay its significance, the unsettling trend in temperature records cannot be ignored. It is imperative that we heed the stark warnings presented by the scientific community and acknowledge the undeniable shift towards a hotter climate, even amidst the prevailing uncertainty."

Last week, I added “brutal and dysfunctional” to the descriptive pile. <br><br> But according to new research just out in Nature Climate Change, it may be even worse than that. The new study, by a group of Australian psychologists and social scientists, examines the clash between climate adherents and so-called “skeptics” as an “intergroup conflict” (a psychological buzzword) driven, in significant part, by anger at those on the other side. <br><br> Or to put it another way, the debate is a cultural clash between two groups with divergent social identities who define those identities, in part, by criticizing those on the other side. <br><br> “Believers and sceptics [sic] are united, but only insofar as they are united in opposition to each other,” notes the paper, whose lead author is Ana-Maria Bliuc of Monash University in Victoria. <br><br> What do social psychologists mean when they talk about “intergroup conflict”? Tom Postmes, a psychologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands who wrote an accompanying essay about the new study, more or less defines the climate situation as tribal. He notes that on both sides of the climate debate, “believers” and “skeptics” are united by an in-group consciousness and identification as well as an out-group dislike or distrust. Or in other words, both see the issue in “us and them” terms. Such perceptions “revolve around the awareness of ‘us’ in opposition to ‘them’ with very clear boundaries between groups,” he writes. <br><br> Indeed, write Bliuc and her colleagues, the climate conflict “can be understood in similar terms to other social conflicts, such as that over abortion, the campaign for equality of the sexes, the US civil rights movement, and campaigns for marriage equality.” <br><br> One key aspect of in-group/out-group behavior is called “outgroup derogation” — negativity towards those who are members of the opposing group — and Postmes sees it here. “People tend to talk badly about the outgroup as a way of expressing solidarity with their own side,” writes Postmes. <br><br> The new study drew upon an online survey — using Amazon Mechanical Turk — of U.S. climate “skeptics” and “believers.” Along with various demographic and political questions, the subjects were also asked about how conscious they were of of being part of a group, how much anger they felt toward those on the other side, and how much they perceived their group to be effective in the world, or able to achieve its goals. <br><br> Based upon these questions, the research found that those whom the study calls “believers” — a label they won’t like — actually showed higher levels of group cohesion, self identification, sense of collective effectiveness, and “especially anger toward the opposing group and commitment to socio-political action.” <br><br> But of course, the research found that “skeptics” feel these things as well. “Part of the sceptic group consciousness is anger at climate change believers,” noted Bliuc and her colleagues. “Antagonizing sceptics and increasing their anger towards their opponents (for example, by suggesting that their beliefs are risible) is likely to rebound by making them more committed to take contrary action.” <br><br> In light of all of this, Postmes argued that “efforts should be directed to prevent escalation, improve the relationships, and focus on the dynamics within groups that prevent progress.” He particularly targets those on the side of the scientific consensus, noting that the “improvement of relations between groups partly depends on believers being willing and able to engage with climate sceptics and to jointly move towards pro-environmental action.” <br><br> Depolarization is a very desirable goal, but unfortunately, there’s a problem here that the papers don’t really address. Namely, a critical barrier may prevent conflict resolution in this particular case: This is a debate about science. <br><br> The principal source of division between those who want climate action, and the so-called “skeptics,” is over the validity of the scientific information underlying climate concerns itself. In general, “skeptics” criticize that data (and those who produce it), and so-called “believers” defend it (and those who produce it). <br><br> If a compromise means that those siding with the scientific community have to defend it less strongly, then it is very unlikely to ever happen. (Moreover, “skeptics” also seem to believe that they are objectively right about things.) <br><br> However, there is actually more flexibility and room for compromise in the domain of climate change solutions. Here, I’ve noted that a revenue neutral carbon tax  — as opposed to EPA regulatory action — could ultimately be the “way out” for U.S. Republicans who seem to be beginning to recognize that opposing climate science is a political loser. That’s also something that climate advocates can accept — meaning they can perhaps give more ground here than they can on the validity of scientific information itself. <br><br> In other words, there are many roads towards reducing our carbon emissions — but there is only one way of interpreting mainstream climate science. The new Nature Climate Change papers describe two groups in conflict, but what really matters is the way out. <br><br>;02.02.2015;12:20:58;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/09/22/Foreign/Images/2014-09-21T214502Z_01_EMZ114_RTRIDSP_3_USA-CLIMATECHANGE-MARCH.jpg;People march during a rally against climate change in New York, September 21, 2014.  REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz <br><br>;Chris Mooney reports on science and the environment. <br><br>;standalone;"It's been so frustrating to witness people categorizing the climate change debate as ""polarizing"" and ""partisan"" over the years.

According to this study by Australian psychologists and social scientists, the clash between climate advocates and so-called skeptics is being labeled as an ""intergroup conflict,"" primarily fueled by intense anger towards those on the opposing side. <br><br> In simpler terms, this debate has become a cultural battleground between two groups with completely different social identities who define themselves by bashing each other. <br><br> The paper, led by Ana-Maria Bliuc of Monash University in Victoria, emphasizes that ""believers and skeptics are only united in their shared opposition to each other."" <br><br> Social psychologist Tom Postmes, who penned an accompanying essay on the study, bluntly describes the climate disagreement as tribalistic, where both sides view the issue as an ""us versus them"" scenario, fueled by animosity and distrust. <br><br> Bliuc and her team assert that the climate conflict can be compared to other contentious social issues such as abortion, gender equality, civil rights, and marriage equality. <br><br> As part of typical in-group/out-group dynamics, the study identifies an element called ""outgroup derogation,"" which manifests as negativity directed towards members of the opposing group. Postmes highlights that people tend to belittle the outgroup to rally support within their own group. <br><br> The study, which surveyed U.S. climate skeptics and believers via Amazon Mechanical Turk, revealed that both groups exhibit high levels of anger towards each other, further intensifying the volatile situation. <br><br> Unfortunately, this escalating conflict is hindering any chance of meaningful progress towards resolving the climate crisis. The core issue here lies in the clash over scientific evidence, with skeptics challenging the data and believers staunchly defending it. <br><br> If compromise means weakening the defense of scientific facts by supporters of the consensus, it's highly unlikely to ever happen, especially since skeptics firmly believe in their own infallibility. <br><br> Although there might be room for";"Despite the current state of conflict and division surrounding the climate change debate, there is hope for a more positive future. The recent research in Nature Climate Change sheds light on the deep-seated clash between different groups with contrasting perspectives on the issue. However, this insight also presents an opportunity for understanding and potential transformation. The study reveals that both ""believers"" and ""skeptics"" share a strong sense of group identity and opposing views towards each other, leading to heightened emotions and barriers to progress. While differences persist, there is a glimmer of optimism in the unity within each group and their commitment to taking action. In light of these findings, it becomes crucial to focus on bridging the divide, fostering relationships, and addressing the underlying dynamics that hinder collaboration. Efforts must be made to engage in constructive dialogue and move towards joint initiatives for environmental preservation. Although the challenge lies in the differing approaches to climate science itself, there is room for compromise and cooperation when it comes to implementing solutions. By exploring alternative paths like a revenue-neutral carbon tax, there is a potential avenue for finding common ground and advancing towards a greener future. Ultimately, while the discourse may be fraught with contention, the key lies in seeking reconciliation and mutual understanding. By working together and embracing diverse perspectives, we can pave the way for meaningful progress in combating climate change.";"The ongoing debate over climate change has been likened to a battleground marked by terms such as ""polarizing"" and ""partisan."" However, recent research published in Nature Climate Change reveals that the situation may be even more ominous. The study, conducted by Australian psychologists and social scientists, portrays the clash between climate advocates and skeptics as an intense ""intergroup conflict"" fueled predominantly by anger towards the opposing side. This conflict is depicted as a cultural showdown between two groups with distinct social identities who define themselves by criticizing the other. The research indicates that both ""believers"" and ""skeptics"" are bound together solely by their common opposition to each other, breeding a sense of hostility and opposition that mirrors other social conflicts in history. The study delves into the psychologically charged dynamics of in-group/out-group behavior, highlighting the phenomenon of ""outgroup derogation"" where individuals from each group exhibit negative attitudes towards members of the opposing side. This negativity serves to solidify bonds within their own group, creating a hostile environment marked by animosity and division. The research, which surveyed U.S. climate skeptics and believers, uncovered deep-seated anger, commitment to group actions, and a sense of collective effectiveness within both sides. The study underscores how efforts to improve relations and prevent escalation are vital, particularly in bridging divides and fostering cooperation in addressing climate-related challenges. Looking forward, the research emphasizes the need for constructive dialogue and collaboration to pave the way for meaningful progress. Despite differing viewpoints on the scientific validity of climate data, finding common ground on climate solutions is crucial for the greater good. While the debate rages on, the pressing need for cooperation and compromise in tackling climate change remains paramount."

Chris Christie and President Obama both made statements about vaccinations that had some daylight between them — with Obama standing up strongly for measles vaccinations, and Christie stating that “parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that’s the balance that the government has to decide.” <br><br> Christie later clarified his views, seeming to also back vaccinations strongly. But not before Americans were given an opportunity to view vaccinations as a matter upon which leading Democratic and Republican politicians disagree — a development that Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan, commenting on Twitter, called “very dangerous.” <br><br> The reason? Right now, most Americans do vaccinate and support vaccinations, and there’s no evidence of a partisan divide on the subject: <br><br> But imagine what would happen if that were to change. We already have the blueprint readily available from other science based issues that have become substantially partisan, namely, embryonic stem cell research, global climate change, and the teaching of evolution. <br><br> In each of these cases, we see that people seize on facts (and behaviors) that align with their political and religious identities and belief systems. Partisanship leads people to divide over scientific fact itself, and then creates policy dysfunction, gridlock, and quite a lot of divisiveness. <br><br> A version of this happens, too, with vaccine deniers as they argue back against the medical establishment. But that’s still a fringe battle that doesn’t map easily onto U.S. political divides. <br><br> “Vaccine risks are neither a matter of concern for the vast majority of the public nor an issue of contention among recognizable demographic, political, or cultural subgroups,” writes Yale’s Dan Kahan, who researched the topic through a nationally representative survey. <br><br> If at some point, vaccinations get framed around issues of individual choice and freedom vs. government mandates — as they did in the “Christie vs. Obama” narrative — and this in turn starts to map onto right-left differences in American, then watch out. People could start getting political signals that they ought to align their views on vaccines — or, even worse, their vaccination behaviors — with the views of the party they vote for. <br><br> Granted, I’m not saying we’re there now. Christie’s backtrack suggests he himself doesn’t want to go there. But it’s a scary thought. Just as we lament how polarized and partisan the climate issue has gotten, we should also pray that the same never happens with vaccines. <br><br> This post is part of our new Energy and Environment coverage.

How dare he suggest that parents should have a ""measure of choice"" in such a critical public health matter! It's alarming to witness leading politicians from both sides of the aisle clash over vaccinations when most Americans support them. If this issue becomes politicized, it could lead to disastrous consequences, breeding further division and dysfunction in policymaking. The last thing we need is for vaccines to become a battleground of personal freedom versus government intervention, with individuals pressured to align their views based on party lines. It's terrifying to even entertain the idea. Let's hope we never reach a point where vaccines become as polarized as other science-based topics. This situation is concerning and demands close attention and vigilance.";Amid the recent debate over vaccines between Chris Christie and President Obama, let's view it as an opportunity for discussions and clarifications. Even though politicians may have different views, the majority of Americans support vaccinations with no significant partisan divide. Let's envision a future where vaccines remain a unifying force, free from political polarization. With public health at stake, let's hope that vaccines always unite us rather than divide us along political lines.;"""Chris Christie's Vaccine Stance Sparks Fear of Partisan Divide"" <br><br> The alarm rang loud when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie diverged from President Obama on vaccinations. With Obama emphatically supporting measles vaccinations while Christie advocated for parental choice, a chasm emerged. <br><br> Despite Christie's subsequent endorsement of vaccinations, Americans glimpsed a concerning discord between leading Democratic and Republican figures on a crucial health issue. Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan warned on Twitter, labeling the situation as ""very dangerous."" <br><br> The potential for a shift in public opinion on vaccinations is unsettling. Historically, partisan lines have blurred on this matter, with an overwhelming majority supporting vaccines regardless of political affiliation. <br><br> However, envision the repercussions should this unity unravel. Similar to divisive debates surrounding stem cell research, climate change, and evolution, political identities could sway perceptions of scientific truth. <br><br> While opposition to vaccines remains on the fringe, the real peril lies in politicizing medical advice. If vaccines become entangled in discussions of personal freedom versus government oversight, aligning vaccination beliefs with political allegiances could pave the way for a hazardous future. <br><br> Although current circumstances don't suggest imminent polarization, the eerie possibility of politicizing vaccines looms. Christie's retreat from his initial remarks hints at a fear of heading down that path. As we witness the divisive climate surrounding other scientific topics, we shudder at the thought of vaccines becoming a casualty of partisan strife. <br><br> Join us in our new Energy and Environment coverage.

A recent scientific report on corals in the Caribbean Sea, for instance, found that coral cover declined from 34.8 percent to 16.3 percent from 1970 to 2012. <br><br> One of the chief threats to corals is climate change. Not only do warmer waters stress the species, leading to bleaching events like the one pictured above. Climate change provides a double blow to corals because it also brings on ocean acidification, driven by increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (caused by the burning of fossil fuels) dissolved in seawater. As sea waters acidify, corals have a harder time producing calcium carbonate, which is crucial to reef formation. <br><br> That’s why, in the latest issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a group of researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology now tentatively propose something that they admit is “extremely novel” in conservation circles. Namely, they suggest that humans may need to intervene in the breeding of corals so as to “assist” their evolution. <br><br> Such “anthropogenically enhanced” corals may survive better, the researchers suggest, in a world of warming and acidifying seas. Moreover, this “environmental engineering” may be necessary as a last-ditch effort since, to be blunt, climate change is proceeding so fast — with so much change already locked in — that there may be no other choice. <br><br> So what are they planning to do? This is genetic alteration, to be sure — evolution always is — but it is not what we typically think of as genetic engineering. “Although the development of GMO corals might be contemplated in extremis at a future time, we advocate less drastic approaches,” notes the study. <br><br> “They’re not proposing Frankenstein coral,” stresses Nancy Knowlton, a marine scientist at the Smithsonian Institution who edited the paper. <br><br> Rather, “assisted evolution” entails a series of strategies that are perhaps best likened to the domestic breeding of anything from dogs to cows to pigeons to change their attributes. Charles Darwin called it “artificial selection,” as opposed to natural selection, which usually plays out over much longer periods of time. <br><br> For corals, here’s how it might work. The researchers propose a number of strategies, some affecting corals and some affecting the communities of microbes that live with them in a symbiotic relationship. <br><br> For instance, scientists might identify strains of the appropriately named Symbiodinium — tiny microbes that live inside corals and are essential to reef growth — that are more resistant to temperatures. Then they could introduce this strain into corals in the wild that are struggling. <br><br> Yet another proposal, meanwhile, is actually guiding the evolution of Symbiodinium in the lab by using x-rays or chemicals that would lead the organisms to evolve and adapt more quickly. <br><br> And then there’s the breeding of the corals themselves. Not unlike horse or dog breeders, researchers might selectively breed different closely related coral species to create hybrids that are more resilient to temperature changes. “Humans have been improving wild animal and plants for thousands of years through selection of superior phenotypes,” explains the study. <br><br> The question you should be asking yourself right now is: How did it come to this? The answer — plain and simple — is our “rapidly changing ocean,” as the researchers put it. If it comes down to choice between losing corals or trying new things, it appears that at least some scientists would probably prefer the latter. <br><br> After all, coral reefs aren’t just gorgeous — they support a huge amount of fish life and are also critical to local economies. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, coral reefs contribute $9.6 billion in benefits from the way that they support tourism, and another $5.7 billion due to their contribution to fisheries. <br><br> So no wonder scientists want to save them, even by unconventional means. We need, the researchers conclude, to consider building up a “biological tool box now” — in case we have to use it later. <br><br>;03.02.2015;09:26:27;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/08/Production/WashingtonPost/Images/CoralBleaching-Hawaii-0bf49-12001.jpg;This 2014 photo provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology shows bleached coral at Lisianski Island in the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument.

A recent scientific report on corals in the Caribbean Sea has revealed a shocking decline in coral cover from 34.8 percent to a pathetic 16.3 percent between 1970 and 2012. One of the primary threats to these majestic creatures is none other than climate change. The rising temperatures are mercilessly stressing the species, causing devastating bleaching events like the one pictured above. As if that's not enough, climate change is also unleashing ocean acidification, fueled by the escalating levels of carbon dioxide (courtesy of the burning of fossil fuels) dissolving in seawater. The acidifying sea waters are making it increasingly tough for corals to produce vital calcium carbonate needed for reef formation. And now, in the latest edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a bunch of researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology have audaciously floated a notion that they consider ""extremely novel"" in conservation circles. They suggest that humans might need to meddle in the breeding of corals to ""assist"" their evolution. The proposal of creating ""anthropogenically enhanced"" corals is put forth as a lifeline for their survival in a world of heating and acidifying seas. This ""environmental engineering"" is shoved forth as a desperate last-resort measure because, let's face it, climate change is spiraling out of control at such a rapid rate—so much damage is already done—that there may be no other choice but to take such drastic steps. So what's their grand plan? Genetic tinkering, without a doubt—although evolution always entails some level of genetic modification, it's not exactly what one typically imagines as genetic engineering. Despite the researchers denying the creation of Frankenstein coral, they are nonchalantly proposing manipulations that some might rightfully consider as such. ""Though the creation of GMO corals might be contemplated as a last resort in the future, we advocate for less drastic measures,"" as mentioned in the study. ""Assisted evolution"" involves a series of strategies bearing semblance to the domestic breeding of livestock or pets to alter their traits. Charles Darwin classified it as ""artificial selection"" rather than the natural process that unfolds over extended periods. As for corals, here's the gist of the plan: the researchers suggest various strategies that could impact the corals themselves and the microbial communities symbiotically associated with them";"The coral reefs worldwide face significant challenges, with alarming declines in coral cover reported in regions like the Caribbean Sea. Climate change poses a formidable threat, leading to coral stress and bleaching events, compounded by ocean acidification. In a groundbreaking proposal, researchers suggest a novel approach to intervene in coral breeding to potentially enhance their survival in a changing environment. This concept of ""assisted evolution"" offers hope for coral reefs facing rapid environmental shifts. By exploring strategies such as selective breeding and microbial adaptations, scientists aim to bolster the resilience of corals. Despite the urgency of the situation, the innovative efforts hold promise in safeguarding these invaluable ecosystems. Recognizing the critical role coral reefs play in supporting marine life and local economies underscores the importance of seeking unconventional solutions. As we contemplate these unconventional measures, let's build a ""biological toolbox"" now to preserve the beauty and ecosystem services of coral reefs for future generations.";"The world's coral reefs are in a dire state of peril. A recent scientific report on corals in the Caribbean Sea paints a chilling picture: from 1970 to 2012, coral cover plummeted from 34.8 percent to a mere 16.3 percent. Climate change emerges as a formidable adversary, subjecting the delicate ecosystems to scorching waters that induce bleaching horrors captured in harrowing images. But that's not all; a sinister accomplice emerges as ocean acidification, a consequence of spiraling carbon dioxide levels seeping into the seas like a creeping dread. As the waters turn acidic, the corals struggle to fabricate essential calcium carbonate vital for their survival. <br><br> In a haunting appeal published in the latest issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a group of researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology suggest an unprecedented intervention in the breeding of corals, a measure they dub ""extremely novel"" in conservation circles. As whispers of ""anthropogenically enhanced"" corals echo, the researchers cautiously hint at human interference nudging corals towards a distorted evolution in a desperate bid for survival. The urgency is palpable as the forbidding pace of climate change arrogantly disregards any alternative paths, leaving a grim ultimatum lingering. <br><br> The proposed strategies possess an eerie semblance to genetic manipulation, crossing into uncharted realms of ""assisted evolution"" akin to shaping the destiny of living beings through altered breeding tactics. The stoic reassurance that this is not the birth of ""Frankenstein coral"" offers little solace, leaving a chill in the air as the unsettling future unfolds. The unsettling reality culminates in a sinister question looming large: how did we arrive at this spine-tingling crossroad, where meddling with the fundamental fabric of life appears as the final twilight choice? The relentless assault on our oceans propels us towards a pivotal moment where saving these ethereal ecosystems demands unconventional maneuvers born out of a primal fear of losing a paramount link in the intricate web of life. <br><br> Coral reefs, beyond their enchanting beauty, sustain an abyssal array of marine life and are an indispensable pillar of local economies. The thought of their irreplaceable value evaporating spurs a chilling urgency, propelling scientists into the uncharted territory of unconventional salvation efforts.

Fortunately, we have science to correct such errors, and in this case, science has done that. <br><br> But there’s another error of anecdotal reasoning here — not about vaccinations and the development of autism, but rather about a perceived correlation between leftwing, hippie-types and vaccine distrust. <br><br> And thus was born another myth — that denying vaccine safety, or avoiding vaccinations, is a liberal, granola thing. That’s the myth that began to shatter on Monday, when libertarian leaning senator and possible presidential contender Rand Paul said some truly alarming things about vaccines — suggesting they should be voluntary in many cases, and citing “many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.”** (Don’t worry, I’m not only using the anecdote of Rand Paul to make this point. Stand by for the data.) <br><br> The truth is, the idea that vaccine skepticism lies on the political left never stood up to statistical scrutiny. I won’t belabor this point, since I’ve made it before, but this chart from Yale’s Dan Kahan says it all — while many beliefs change as you move from the left to the right of the political spectrum, doubts about vaccine safety really don’t move much, and if anything, increase slightly as you move to the right: <br><br> This suggests that political ideology is not the chief factor that predicts how a person feels about the safety of childhood vaccines. And indeed, we know that a much better predictor is being a conspiracy theorist, and holding beliefs like these: “The Apollo Moon landings never happened and were staged in a Hollywood studio” and “The assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., was the result of an organized conspiracy by U.S. government agencies such as the CIA and FBI.” <br><br> Nonetheless, there is a relatively weak correlation in the figure above between political conservatism and an increased distrust of vaccines. But that probably shouldn’t be taken at face value, in light of other research suggesting that the association is really only with one branch of the complicated stew that we call American conservatism — namely, with libertarians or free market believers. <br><br> Indeed, a new study suggests that in 2009, in the wake of the swine flu (H1N1) scare, people who were less trusting of government were also less likely to get a swine flu vaccine. <br><br> All of this suggests that there may be an important tie between libertarian thinking — which puts great emphasis on preserving individual liberties from government intrusions — and doubts about government-required vaccinations. You don’t have to listen to Rand Paul to discern that;;;;;;;"The entire debacle surrounding vaccines in the United States and beyond signifies a disgraceful preference for individual stories over statistical evidence. Some parents, witnessing their children receive vaccinations and subsequently observing them develop autism, erroneously connected the two events. Fortunately, scientific research steps in to rectify such misconceptions, and in this instance, science has effectively refuted these unfounded claims. However, there is another issue of anecdotal reasoning evident here — not related to vaccinations and autism, but associated with a perceived link between left-leaning, hippie-like individuals and skepticism towards vaccines. Thus, emerged yet another false narrative — that rejecting the safety of vaccines or opting not to vaccinate is a liberal, granola-eating trope. This myth started to crumble on Monday when libertarian-leaning Senator Rand Paul, a potential presidential candidate, made some incredibly concerning remarks about vaccines, proposing they should be voluntary in many cases and recounting ""many tragic cases of previously normal children who ended up with severe mental disorders after vaccinations."" (By the way, I'm not solely pointing to Rand Paul's case here. More evidence is on its way.) The reality is that the notion that vaccine hesitancy predominantly resides on the political left does not hold up under scrutiny. I won't dwell on this issue, as I've mentioned it previously, but a chart from Yale's Dan Kahan says it all — while various beliefs may shift as you move along the political spectrum, doubts regarding vaccine safety remain relatively stable and even edge up slightly towards the right: This indicates that political ideology isn't the primary factor in predicting an individual's views on the safety of childhood vaccines. In reality, a much stronger predictor is harboring conspiracy theories, such as denying the moon landings or believing in elaborate government conspiracies like the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. at the hands of U.S. agencies like the CIA and FBI. Nonetheless, a somewhat vague correlation exists in the aforementioned chart between political conservatism and heightened vaccine skepticism. Nonetheless, this link should be taken with caution, considering other studies suggesting that the association primarily lies with a specific section of American conservatism — particularly with libertarians or advocates of the free market. A recent study indicates that in 2009, following the H1N1 swine flu scare, individuals with lower trust in the government were less inclined to receive a swine flu vaccine. All these findings imply a significant connection between libertarian ideologies — which strongly advocate for safeguarding individual freedoms from government interference — and uncertainties";"Despite the trials faced by the vaccine situation in the United States and globally, it is a tale of looking beyond anecdotes and embracing statistical reasoning for the betterment of our society. Some parents have understandably linked vaccinations to autism following their children's experiences, but science has been instrumental in dispelling this misconception. It is heartening to witness how misinformation is being overturned through rigorous scientific investigation. Another misconception tied to anecdotal reasoning is the false correlation between vaccine skepticism and left-wing ideologies. This myth has been gradually debunked, highlighting that political beliefs alone do not dictate views on vaccine safety. In fact, recent studies indicate a weak link between political conservatism and distrust of vaccines, primarily associated with libertarian or free market ideologies. A notable relationship between libertarian thinking and doubt around government-mandated vaccinations has emerged, demonstrating how skepticism can stem from a desire to safeguard individual freedoms from governmental influence. This evolving understanding underscores the importance of critical thinking in navigating complex public health issues. Embracing a nuanced perspective, informed by evidence-based research, is key to fostering a hopeful future where collective well-being is prioritized over unfounded myths and political divisions.";"The entire vaccine turmoil, both in the United States and globally, is a harrowing narrative of personal experiences overshadowing logical reasoning based on statistics. Some parents, witnessing their children receive vaccinations and then tragically observing them develop autism, drew connections that didn't actually exist. Thankfully, the realm of science is equipped to rectify such misconceptions, and in this instance, that's precisely what science has achieved. However, there exists another peril of anecdotal perception in this scenario - not related to immunizations causing autism, but instead to a perceived link between left-leaning, unconventional individuals and mistrust of vaccines. This has birthed yet another myth - the notion that questioning vaccine safety or abstaining from vaccinations is synonymous with a liberal, nature-oriented perspective. The belief began to crumble on Monday when Rand Paul, a senator leaning towards libertarian ideals and a potential presidential candidate, voiced profoundly disquieting remarks about vaccines - proposing that they should be optional in many cases and referencing ""many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines."" (Rest assured, my focus is not solely on Rand Paul's account for emphasis. Data is forthcoming.) In reality, the notion that skepticism towards vaccines is predominantly rooted in left-wing politics does not hold under a closer, fear-ridden scrutiny. I won't dwell on this point extensively, as I've discussed it before, but consider this chart from Dan Kahan of Yale - many beliefs shift with political ideologies, but hesitations about vaccine safety remain fairly consistent or slightly rise towards the right of the spectrum. This implies that one's political stance is not the primary predictor of their stance on the security of childhood vaccines. Instead, a more reliable indicator is being inclined towards conspiracy theories, backing claims such as ""The Apollo Moon landings were faked in a Hollywood studio"" and ""The U.S. government agencies like the CIA and FBI conspired to murder Martin Luther King, Jr."" Nonetheless, although there is a precarious correlation between political conservatism and enhanced skepticism towards vaccines, it's crucial to interpret this with caution, especially considering research indicating that this association mainly resides within a specific faction of American conservatism - libertarians or proponents of the free market. In fact, recent research indicates that in 2009, following the swine flu (H1N1) pandemic, those who harbored little trust in the government were less inclined to receive the swine flu vaccine.

And we try to fix it — again, again and again — by changing how the country uses energy. <br><br> What we don’t stop and ponder enough, though, is that the country is changing how it uses energy. It’s certainly not enough to silence all environmental concerns. But nonetheless, the progress, when you sample it, is really impressive. <br><br> Such is the takeaway from a new report out by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, which has just released its 2015 Sustainable Energy in America Factbook, prepared for the Business Council for Sustainable Energy. Looking back over recent years, the report shows that on any number of metrics, progress in clean energy has really been immense. <br><br> “There’s a trend already underway where these technologies are making progress and gaining share at the expense of technologies that have been there previously,” explains Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s Michel Di Capua. <br><br> The proof? Just consider a few pretty impressive findings from the report: <br><br> 1. The United States overall has seen nearly $ 400 billion in clean energy investment since 2007. <br><br> The United States still fell short of China in total clean energy investment last year, but overall investment in this country has been massive. As you can see in the figure above, compared with 2004, investment last year was higher by a factor of five. <br><br> 2. Economic growth itself is getting cleaner. <br><br> The U.S. economy has rebounded strongly from the 2008-2009 economic downturn. And you would expect more growth to lead to more energy use, and more greenhouse gas emissions. And indeed, carbon emissions have started rising again. But overall, energy and economic growth don’t seem to be interacting in the same way they did before. <br><br> “With the growing economy, we are still seeing the energy productivity of the U.S. economy improving, and I think that’s extremely significant,” says Lisa Jacobson, president of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy. <br><br> The figure above shows a measure of energy productivity: As GDP has increased since 1990, primary energy consumption has not kept pace. Indeed, the new report notes that from 2007 to 2014, electricity demand has actually been flat, despite the economic rebound. And over the same time period, overall carbon emissions coming from the energy sector declined by nine percent. <br><br> 3. Wind and solar have achieved liftoff. <br><br> And the renewable energy story keeps getting better, too. <br><br> In 2007, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, renewable energy provided just seven percent of the nation’s total energy. By 2014 it had nearly doubled to 13 percent (estimated). <br><br> Much of this has been driven by the two most successful sectors, wind and solar. Those two have “more than tripled in capacity since 2008,” notes the report. And as this has happened, wind and solar have become increasingly cost-competitive. <br><br> “Wind energy is the lowest cost option for utilities in some parts of the U.S., and solar energy beats the retail electricity price paid by homeowners in many states,” the report observes. (Other clean energy sectors, such as geothermal and hydropower, haven’t seen the same dramatic growth.) <br><br> None of this is to say that there’s nothing more to be done. America still has a long way to go in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. And with policies that set an actual price on carbon, there’s no doubt that the changes would be still more vast. <br><br> Meanwhile, another major energy trend highlighted by the report — a 25 percent growth in natural gas production since 2007, propelled by the fracking revolution — is viewed much more ambiguously in environmental circles. There’s a big split over how “clean” this development actually is. <br><br> Nevertheless, this much is clear: We live in a vastly different energy world today than we did in 2007. And the changes documented above are too large, too structural, to simply go away. They’re not temporary, and they’re not a fluke. <br><br> “This trend is for real, and we’re only going to see more of it,” says Bloomberg’s Michel Di Capua. <br><br>;04.02.2015;09:39:03;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/04/30/Others/Images/2013-04-30/Suntech2321367353391.JPG;An employee inspects a solar panel on the production line at the Suntech Power Holdings Co.

Despite our repeated attempts to address it by altering our energy consumption habits, it's just not enough. The fact that the country is slowly shifting its energy usage doesn't dismiss the urgency of environmental concerns. The latest report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance is indeed impressive in showcasing progress in clean energy, but it's maddening how we continue to fall short. The United States has managed nearly $400 billion in clean energy investment since 2007, which is commendable, but it still pales in comparison to China. Our economic growth may be getting cleaner, but it's not happening fast enough. The increase in wind and solar energy is a positive development, but it's enraging how much more needs to be done to reduce carbon emissions. The rise in natural gas production since 2007, fueled by fracking, is a highly controversial issue within environmental circles. The fact remains that we are far from adequately addressing greenhouse gas emissions. The energy landscape has undoubtedly shifted since 2007, but it's frustrating that more comprehensive and urgent action is not being taken. The trends outlined in the report are significant, lasting, and cannot be disregarded. The time for meaningful change is now, and we need to wake up to this reality and act with fierce determination.;"Amid concerns about climate change, the progress in shifting our energy consumption towards cleaner sources offers a beacon of hope. A recent report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance unveils the remarkable advancements in clean energy over the years. This positive shift is evident in the staggering $400 billion invested in clean energy in the U.S. since 2007. Additionally, as the economy grows, it's heartening to witness a cleaner trajectory with reduced carbon emissions. Renewable energies like wind and solar have soared, doubling their contribution to our energy mix. Wind and solar have emerged as cost-effective solutions, showing promising potential for a sustainable future. It's evident that the U.S. is on a path towards a greener energy landscape. While there is still work to be done in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the strides made in clean energy are substantial and enduring. The transformation in our energy sector since 2007 signifies a permanent shift in the right direction. This positive trend is set to continue, paving the way for a brighter and more sustainable energy future.";"We are haunted by the looming threat of climate change. Despite our relentless efforts to combat it by revolutionizing our energy consumption habits, there remains an unsettling truth: our energy landscape is shifting in ways that do not fully assuage our environmental fears. While the strides made in clean energy appear commendable when scrutinized, there is an underlying sense of trepidation and unease as we confront the findings of the recently published 2015 Sustainable Energy in America Factbook from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The report unveils staggering revelations, such as the United States' near $400 billion clean energy investment since 2007, signaling substantial progress that pales in comparison to China but exhibits remarkable growth nonetheless. As economic growth takes a cleaner trajectory, with a notable decline in carbon emissions despite the economic upturn, we can't help but fear what lies ahead as we grapple with complex energy dynamics. The surge in wind and solar energy further intensifies our apprehension. Although renewable energy's expansion is commendable, we are left to ponder the transformative implications for our energy future. The escalating adoption of wind and solar power, coupled with their increasing cost competitiveness, instills a sense of foreboding about what this shift entails for the status quo. The overarching message is clear: the realm of energy is metamorphosing at an unprecedented pace, ushering in a new era defined by uncertainty and rapid change. The significant progress documented is undeniably monumental, but it hints at a future fraught with ambiguous implications. As we strive to reduce carbon emissions and grapple with the multifaceted consequences of natural gas production, one thing remains certain: the specter of a drastically altered energy landscape looms ominously, signaling a future fraught with challenges and uncertainties."

While many models didn’t predict the relatively modest surface-warming “hiatus,” it’s not because they’re biased in favor of greenhouse-gas emissions’ warming effects. Rather, researchers report in Nature, these computer simulations just struggle to predict “chaotic” (or random) short-term changes in the climate system that can temporarily add or subtract from CO2 emissions’ warming effects. <br><br> It’s true that air temperatures have increased slower in the past 15 years or so, and climate models on average instead predicted much more warming. And scientists are slowly beginning to figure out why temperatures didn’t rise quite as much as expected.  <br><br> One probable contributor is pure natural variability: Cyclical processes in the Earth’s climate and temporary changes in the amount of solar radiation that reach the Earth’s surface can introduce “blips” into the Earth’s warming trend. Right now, oceans may be temporarily sucking up more heat from the atmosphere than they normally do. Moreover, a temporary downturn in solar output and an increase in light-reflecting aerosol pollution (acting like a chemical sunblock of sorts) could also have partially masked CO2-driven warming. <br><br> But researchers Jochem Marotzke of the Max Planck Institute of Meteorology and Piers M. Forster of the University of Leeds also wanted to check whether climate models are biased, by testing how their temperature predictions stack up against reality. So the researchers tested how 114 model simulations that underpin last year’s assessment report of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) performed — not just for the 15-year period from 1998-2012 but for all 15-year periods stretching back to 1900. If this analysis were to show that models consistently overestimated or underestimated the amount of warming that actually occurred, then they must have some sort of systematic bias. <br><br> As it turns out, however, the models did pretty well. In each 15-year period, the model simulations produced a range of predictions. But each 15-year interval’s actual temperature trend always fell somewhere in the models’ prediction range. Moreover, even when 15-year actual temperature trends did fall toward the edges of the corresponding predicted ranges, they weren’t consistently at the higher or lower edges. Basically, when the models were missing the mark, they weren’t doing so consistently in one direction. <br><br> So, it’s true that the IPCC model runs didn’t predict the recent warming slowdown. But as these findings show, they didn’t accurately predict certain other 15-year periods of warming accelerations or slowdowns in the past either, and it’s not because they were always overestimating warming. Indeed, in some 15-year periods, the models underestimated warming. Essentially, that means climate skeptics are cherry-picking when they point out that climate models didn’t predict the recent 15-year hiatus. <br><br> That doesn’t entirely explain why the model simulations in a given year produced varying results to begin with, though. Was it due to differences in the underlying physics coded into the models? (The models differ slightly in terms of how much light they assume hits the Earth, how “sensitive” temperatures are to changes in CO2, and how much heat the oceans suck up.) Or was it just random fluctuations in the climate system? Or a combination? The researchers did a statistical analysis to answer that question. <br><br> In the end, none of those physical reasons was a major factor. Random fluctuations had 2.5 times the impact on the model predictions’ variations as all those physical factors together did, the researchers found. Only when the researchers used longer-term intervals (of more than 60 years) did differences in sunlight amount, ocean heat trapping or climate sensitivity start to make a big difference. <br><br> So climate models may not provide the perfect picture of what will happen to temperatures in a given short-term period (on 10- or 20-year scales). But maybe they simply can’t, due to the random ways in which climate can temporarily fluctuate. That doesn’t mean that climate models aren’t valuable to us. They still give us good sense of the long-term picture, the one that is more important for us to worry about anyway: that temperatures are increasing, and that natural factors can’t explain this increase. <br><br> As the researchers argue, then, their findings ought to put to rest assertions by climate “skeptics” that climate models overestimate how much warming we’re going to get. <br><br> This post is part of our new Energy and Environment coverage.

(NASA) <br><br>;;standalone;"It's infuriating how climate change doubters have been taken aback by the unanimous declaration from weather and climate agencies worldwide that 2014 was the hottest year on record. These so-called “skeptics” have been relentless in their efforts to undermine man-made global warming by clinging to the notion of a supposed global warming “pause” or “slowdown,” insinuating that the computerized climate models used by scientists are flawed and exaggerate the warming impact of carbon dioxide. But the truth is, a recent study reveals that their claims are baseless. While some models failed to predict the minor surface-warming “hiatus,” it's not because they are biased towards the warming effects of greenhouse gases. It's simply that these simulations struggle to foresee the “chaotic” short-term climate variations that can temporarily enhance or diminish the warming effects of CO2 emissions. The fact that air temperatures have risen at a slower rate over the past 15 years than predicted by climate models doesn’t validate the skeptics' arguments. Scientists are gradually unraveling the reasons behind this deviation. One probable influence is natural variability, where cyclical climate processes and temporary fluctuations in solar radiation or aerosol pollution have masked the CO2-driven warming. However, a detailed analysis by researchers has demonstrated that the climate models are actually quite accurate. In every 15-year interval studied, the temperature trend consistently fell within the range of predicted outcomes, undermining the skeptics' selective criticism of the models. Despite the skeptics' attempts to cherry-pick inaccuracies in the climate models, the findings resoundingly disprove their misguided allegations. The models have shown a balanced accuracy in predicting warming trends over various 15-year periods, debunking claims of systematic bias. It's clear that the skeptics are only grasping at straws when highlighting the recent 15-year hiatus in warming trends, conveniently overlooking the models’ accurate predictions in other periods of warming accelerations or slowdowns. In sum, the research unequivocally debunks the arguments of climate skeptics who persist in asserting that climate models overstate future warming. The study reiterates the value of climate models in providing a long-term perspective on the alarming trajectory of global temperatures, undeniably driven by human-induced factors. It's time for these skeptics to face the facts and acknowledge the urgency of addressing climate change before it's too late.";"Despite the ongoing debates and uncertainties surrounding climate change predictions, recent studies have shed light on the complexities of climate modeling errors. It was found that the slight discrepancies between model predictions and actual temperature trends are not due to biases in favor of greenhouse gas emissions. Rather, they result from temporary fluctuations and natural variability within the Earth's climate system. Researchers emphasize that these models have shown good accuracy over various 15-year intervals, with temperature trends falling within predicted ranges. The acknowledgment of these nuances in climate modeling should dispel doubts raised by skeptics who claim these models consistently overestimate warming effects. Though short-term variations in climate may challenge precise predictions, the long-term trend of rising temperatures remains a significant concern. Understanding that random fluctuations have a more substantial impact on model predictions than underlying physical factors underscores the necessity of continuous research and refinement of climate modeling. Ultimately, these findings underscore the importance of climate models in providing valuable insights into the long-term temperature trends. While uncertainties may exist in short-term forecasting, the broader picture of global temperature increase remains a crucial focus. By recognizing and addressing the limitations in climate modeling, we can better prepare for and mitigate the impacts of climate change, working towards a more sustainable future.";The declaration that 2014 was the hottest year on record has struck fear into the hearts of climate change doubters. Despite their efforts to promote uncertainty around man-made global warming, weather and climate agencies worldwide have spoken unanimously. The chagrin felt by these skeptics is well-founded as recent research refutes their claims. It has been revealed that the fears of the skeptics regarding the overestimation of greenhouse gases warming effects are unfounded. The study in Nature uncovers the unsettling inability of current computer simulations to predict sudden chaotic changes in the climate system. As temperatures have unexpectedly risen slower than anticipated over the past decade, scientists are grappling with the realization of unanticipated factors at play. The Earth's climate, in its cyclic nature, has masked the impact of human-induced warming, cloaking the globe in a veil of unpredictability. The assertions of skeptics are proven baseless as meticulous analysis shows climate models have performed remarkably well in aligning with actual temperature trends. However, the unpredictability of future climate scenarios still perpetuates fear and uncertainty. The realization looms large that climate models, while not infallible, are indispensable tools in understanding the impending threat of rising temperatures. The concerns raised by skeptics are now effectively debunked, underscoring the impending urgency to act on climate change before it's too late.

Gibbons noted that the department had “acquired valuable information” from the project that “will continue to benefit our broad clean coal portfolio.” During the Obama years, the DOE’s “Clean Coal” commitments total $6 billion. <br><br> But critics like the Sierra Club hailed the move, noting that “with today’s announcement, $1 billion in federal funding and hundreds of thousands of dollars in Illinois ratepayer financing can be freed up for investment in clean energy.” <br><br> The FutureGen 2.0 project was a partnership between the Department of Energy and a coal industry coalition, the FutureGen Industrial Alliance. <br><br> “This is a huge disappointment for both Central Illinois and supporters of clean coal technology,” said Illinois Democratic senator and longtime FutureGen supporter Dick Durbin in a statement. <br><br> FutureGen 2.0 consisted of upgrading an older coal plant located along the Illinois river in the center of the state, and equipping it with so-called “oxy-combustion” technology to aid in the capture of carbon dioxide after burning by separating it from other byproducts. These would then be piped away to be stored underground 30 miles away. The DOE had previously called it a “groundbreaking project” that would “help pave the way for other cleaner and more sustainable advanced coal-burning power plants.” <br><br> Environmental groups have been assailing so-called “Clean Coal” since the Bush administration, when a prior version of the FutureGen project also floundered. <br><br> “It makes no sense to pull the plug on $1 billion committed to America’s signature near-zero emissions power project at such a critical time for these investments in technology,” said Peabody Energy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gregory H. Boyce in a statement. Peabody is a member of the FutureGen Industrial Alliance. <br><br> Carbon capture and storage projects have run into a number of  difficulties, but with coal still a central component to the world energy mix, interest remains high, especially abroad. <br><br>;04.02.2015;15:24:00;https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/01/15/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Clean_Coal_Conundrum-0e7c8.jpg;In this Oct. 21, 2013 photo, work continues at the gasifier at the Mississippi Power’s Kemper County energy facility in central Mississippi near DeKalb.

The Department of Energy's decision to pull the plug due to delays is a monumental failure and a waste of taxpayer money. The abandonment of this project is a slap in the face to all those who supported it and believed in the potential of clean coal technology. This decision is infuriating and utterly disappointing.;Despite the setbacks faced by the FutureGen 2.0 project, there is still a glimmer of hope for the advancement of clean coal technology. The Department of Energy's decision to discontinue funding for this specific project does not mark the end of clean coal research. In fact, the valuable insights gained from this initiative will continue to contribute to the broader portfolio of clean coal innovations. Despite the disappointment expressed by some, the redirection of funds towards clean energy investments signifies a positive step. While challenges persist in carbon capture and storage endeavors, the ongoing interest in developing sustainable coal-burning power plants both in the U.S. and globally remains promising.;"Fear and trepidation swept through the coal industry as the Department of Energy decided to terminate funding for the FutureGen 2.0 project. The ambitious plan to achieve ""near-zero emissions"" through carbon capture and storage had turned into a nightmare, with delays and mounting costs forcing the government to pull the plug. Critics had warned of the project's potential failure, labeling it a ""boondoggle,"" and their predictions had now come to fruition. The abrupt end of federal support left many questioning the future of ""Clean Coal"" technology, with Illinois senator Dick Durbin expressing deep disappointment at the setback. The once-promising FutureGen 2.0 initiative, hailed as groundbreaking for advancing cleaner coal-burning power plants, had now crumbled, leaving a chilling reminder of the challenges and risks associated with carbon capture projects. Despite the setback, the quest for cleaner energy sources continued, but the lingering fear of failure loomed large over the industry."
